These actions can be done via the influencer table or the influencer's profile page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Influencers can nominate their payment method preference (i.e. PayPal or store credit). This allows you to filter commission payments in a way that ensures influencers are only paid by their preferred method. Note: you can ignore their preference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can now cancel commission payments (manual transfer only for now)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have added improved table sorting to the influencer and orders tables. This makes influencer management and performance analysis much simpler.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added youtube linking</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All linked social media profile avatars are now hosted on our CDN. No more broken avatars!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The discount code within each order is visible on the orders table and orders export</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The orders table (commission section) includes a info tooltip, that will allow you to see why/how our track awarded commission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your invoice will now display any PayPal fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We now proactively monitor specific coupon code sites for influencer code dumping activity. This is a practice that is against our T&#x26;Cs, however this measure is designed to detect and revoke access to bad influencers automatically. This is an opt-in solution and can be enabled via your store settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our new rules based promotion policy system is in beta and available to a few select early access stores. It will be available shortly for everyone. This new rules design is a huge leap forward for our platform and will offer complete control and automation over the behaviour of your account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our new in-app messaging feature is being rolled out to all users. It is a beta feature that must be enabled via <code class=\"language-text\">my account > store settings</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have simplified the influencer profile UX. Their account management and promotion policy pages have been merged into their home page. This is part of our goal of creating a single-page UX for influencers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can now allow influencers to see the name of the customer for their referral orders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've upgraded our database infrastructure and run-time technology.
