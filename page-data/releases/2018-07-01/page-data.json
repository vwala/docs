You can now pay sales commission out on all un-paid orders via PayPal in one step. No selection required! You can of course still pay commission on only a select number of orders at a time. We've also made quite a few usability improvements to the form.</li>\n<li>We've fixed some issues where IP tracking wasn't working for clients in India.</li>\n<li>We've improved our handling of POS orders to be more robust.</li>\n<li>We've improved our support of partially fulfilled orders.</li>\n<li>We've spent some time re-checking our security implementation and have tightened up a few areas even more. Making sure vwa.la protects your privacy is always a #1 priority.</li>\n<li>We've optimised our PayPal payment processing back-end to be much more efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to all who have given their feedback.
