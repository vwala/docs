How to create an influencer account
-----------------------------------

To sign-up a new influencer, you can use the in-store widget or; share you sign-up link.

E.g. [**yourstore.com**/referrer-signup.](http://mystore.com/influencer-signup)

_Replace_ [_yourstore.com_](http://mystore.com) _with your domain name._  
  
When an influencer signs up:

*   They must choose a unique, personalized influencer ID (i.e. jen).
*   We uses this ID to automatically create their influencer link and discount code for your store. E.g. link = [yourstore.com/jen](http://mystore.com/jen), discount code = jen.
*   The ID must be unique to your store. I.e. it must not be the same as an existing discount code.

How to create a TEST influencer account
---------------------------------------

If you wish to test the platform as an influencer, you can create a test influencer account using your influencer sign-up link (above).

When you open this link in your browser, you may see the below screenshot.

This is because you are already logged in to vwa.la as a merchant. In this case, you need to either 1) log out of vwa.la and; then re-open the sign-up page or 2) open the sign-up link in a new browser session (i.e. Chrome = incognito, IE/Edge/Firefox = new session).

#### Important - You must disable our fraud system during testing

vwa.la has a built-in anti-fraud system**.** This system prevents a influencer from creating personal orders.

If you have created a test influencer and are creating test orders, you must first enable personal orders before creating your test order. When you have finished your testing, you can then disable personal orders.

You can enable/disable personal orders via my account > store settings > business rules.

How to bulk import influencers from another app
-----------------------------------------------

For those of you who are moving to vwa.la from another app, we can help you auto-load your influencers into your vwa.la account. All we need from you is an Excel/CSV file with their account details. Most apps will provide an export feature, if not, you'll need to manually create this file. Then simply email the file to [support@vwa.la](mailto:support@vwa.la) and we will handle the upload process for you.

At a minimum, the file should contain the following fields:

*   Name
*   Email
*   A unique personalised influencer id (used to create a link/discount code). This must not conflict with an existing discount code in your store.  
    

Optionally, the following fields are also highly desirable:

*   Facebook/Instagram/Youtube/Twitter username  
    
*   The influencer group that they should be added to. I.e. Normal, VIP.
