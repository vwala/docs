## How to create a TEST influencer account

If you wish to test the platform as an influencer, you can create a test influencer account using your influencer sign-up link.

E.g. [**yourstore.com**/referrer-signup.](http://mystore.com/referrer-signup) 

_Replace_ [_yourstore.com_](http://mystore.com) _with your domain name._  

When you open this link in your browser, you may see the below screenshot.

This is because you are already logged in to vwa.la as a merchant. In this case, you need to either 1) log out of vwa.la and; then re-open the sign-up page or 2) open the sign-up link in a new browser session (i.e. Chrome = incognito, IE/Edge/Firefox = new session).

#### Important - You must disable our fraud system during testing

vwa.la has a built-in anti-fraud system. This system prevents a influencer from creating personal orders.

If you have created a test influencer and are creating test orders, you must first enable personal orders before creating your test order. When you have finished your testing, you can then disable personal orders.

You can enable/disable personal orders via my account > store settings > business rules.

## How to import influencers from another app

If you are moving to vwa.la from another app, we can help you import your influencers into your account. All we need from you is a `CSV` file with their account details (if using Excel please save your Excel file to `CSV`). Most apps will provide an export feature, if not you'll need to manually create this file. Then simply email the `CSV` file to [support@vwa.la](mailto:support@vwa.la) and we will handle the upload process for you.

At a minimum, the file should contain the following fields:

- Required
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email
    - Code: A unique personalised influencer id (used to create a link/discount code). This must not conflict with an existing discount code in your store.  
- Optional:    
    - Facebook/Instagram/Youtube/Twitter username  
    - The influencer group that they should be added to. I.e. Normal, VIP.

#### Required CSV format

Please match the column names. Order is not important
