Congratulations on creating your influencer marketing program! This article is here to help you get started.

## First steps

-  On installation, we created an account for you and we sent you an email with your login details (to the same email address registered as the owner of your shopify store, which may be different to your shopify login email address)
-  [Customise](/merchant/customisation) the style and behaviour of vwa.la. This includes your theme, sign up page behaviour, welcome email template, 3rd party app integration etc.
-  [Customise influencer commission rules](/merchant/influencer-commission) and how are commissions calculated / paid?
-  [Find and invite influencers](/merchant/inviting-influencers) to join your influencer marketing program

## Optional steps

-  [Add a marketing page to your store](/merchant/adding-a-page-to-your-store). This page will introduce your customers or prospective influencers to your influencer marketing program and help them sign-up.
-  [Bulk load influencers](/merchant/how-to-create-a-test-account-or-bulk-upload-data) from another referral/affiliate/influencer marketing app

## Testing
-  [Create a test influencer account](/merchant/how-to-create-a-test-account-or-bulk-upload-data) so that you can experience how a influencer will use your influencer marketing program.
