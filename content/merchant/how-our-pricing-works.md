Flexible, fair pricing 

All of our plans:

*   Include 14 days free trial\*
*   Are full featured (for this reason, we don't have fixed price plans)
*   Can be changed or cancelled at any time.
*   Have a 30 day billing cycle.
*   Are in USD.

We offer the following plans. They are designed to be cheaper as your sales volume grows and you upgrade.

[Startup plan](https://www.vwa.la/#/pricing)
--------------------------------------------

The start-up plan:

*   Has a low cost monthly base fee.
*   Has all features, with some minor limits.

The start-up plan is designed to give you time to grow your influencer marketing program. That's why we have a minimal base fee. Because the startup plan is full featured, we do charge a commission (4.95%) on all referral generated orders. This is a % of the total referral order earnings within each 30 day billing period. Note: we exclude all customer discounts, taxes and shipping costs in our calculations.

See the FAQ section for a example of how commission is calculated.

[Growth/Standard plans](https://www.vwa.la/#/pricing)
-----------------------------------------------------

Eventually your sales will outgrow the start-up plan and you will want to **reduce your costs**. So once you start earning a ROI from [vwa.la](http://vwa.la), it will be cheaper for you to upgrade to either the growth or standard plans. These plans offer a progressively cheaper commission fee.

FAQ

####How is per influencer order commission calculated?

For every influencer order, commission is calculated based on the order total, minus customer discounts, taxes and shipping costs.

I.e.

*   For an order with a value of $30 (minus shipping and taxes)
*   Minus a 20% customer discount
*   The order amount would equal $24
*   Our commission for that order would be calculated as X% of $24. E.g. on the standard plan, 1.95% of $24 would be $0.468.

####What if I change my plan?

It's free to upgrade / downgrade your plan at any time. If you change billing plan mid-month, we pro-rata your billing.

####How am I billed?

All billing is through your Shopify account.

####How long is a billing cycle?

Our billing cycles are exactly 30 days, commencing from the date of install.

####Which plans include a 14 free trial?

The 14 day trial applies to all plans.

This trial period is intended for evaluation use. To protect our business from those who wish to run pre-sales activities on [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) and then cancel before the trial period ends, we reserve the right to charge you commission per referral order during the trial period if your referral sales volumes are significant.
