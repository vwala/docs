Whilst most influencers who join your referral marketing program do the right thing by your brand, occasionally you will find influencers who misuse their influencer discount codes by creating self-purchases or by spamming them across the web.

Here is what you need to do to protect your brand:

Define your T&Cs
----------------

We recommend you create a store page that introduces your influencer marketing program and states your terms and conditions clearly.

Follow the steps outlined [here](/merchant/adding-a-page-to-your-store) to create your own store page.

Cancel their account
--------------------

If you no longer wish to partner with the influencer, you can delete their account by revoking their discount links / codes. You can do this from the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) > Influencer Codes page.

Cancel their order commission
-----------------------------

If you do not want to disable the influencers' account, you can void any order commission that they have earned. You can do this from the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) > Orders page. Simply select the orders you want to cancel and then click the 'Cancel orders' button at the bottom of the page.
