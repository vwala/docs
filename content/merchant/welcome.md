## FAQ 


#### Is referral, affiliate and influencer marketing the same thing?

Yes, that's right. 

Referral/affiliate/influencer/ambassador marketing bascially mean the same thing. There are subtle differences, but they are trivial in practice. So feel free to use whichever term suits your brand the best!

#### How often do you release updates?

Every week, since 2017. We are constantly adding new features and improvements. So if you have a feature request, let us know. All feature requests are added to a job queue with a simple voting structure. The more times a feature is requested, the higher it's priority.
