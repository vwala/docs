## FAQ 

### Is referral, affiliate and influencer marketing the same thing?

Yes, that's right. 

Referral/affiliate/influencer/ambassador marketing bascially mean the same thing. There are subtle differences, but they are trivial in practice. So feel free to use whichever term suits your brand the best!

### How often do you release updates?

Every week, since 2017. 

We are constantly adding new features and improvements. So if you have a feature request, let us know. All feature requests are added to a job queue with a simple voting structure. The more times a feature is requested, the higher it's priority. There is generally a wait time before requested features are delivered, depending on our work load and feature complexity. We do our best to be very accomodating.

### Do you support development stores? 

Not at this time. You'll need a production store that can activate a billing plan to use the product and evaluate the free trial. If you are a developer and want to use a development store, let us know.
