When you signed up to vwa.la, we automatically created a promotion policy for your store. You can view your promotion policy from the vwa.la menu (promotions option).**  
  
What is a promotion policy?  
**A [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) promotion policy is the same as a sales promotion  but instead of applying to your customers, it applies to your influencers.

It allows you to:

*   Control how much commission your influencers earn per sale
*   Control if (and how much) discount your customers receive when using the influencer's discount code.
*   Control which products influencers can earn sales commission from and/or; which products customers will receive discounts for.

**Can I set influencer specific rules?**  
Yes. You can segment your influencers into groups and configure promotion rules for each group separately by firstly creating a new group within the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) > influencer> influencer groups page. New groups are automatically added to your promotion policy. You can then configure rules specific to that new group using the promotions page.
