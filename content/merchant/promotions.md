When you signed up to vwa.la, we automatically created a default promotion policy for your store. You can view and edit your promotion policy from the vwa.la > promotion policy menu. 
  
## What is a promotion policy?
A promotion policy is the same as a sales promotion but instead of applying to your customers, it applies to your influencers.

It allows you to:

-  Control how much commission your influencers earn per sale
-  Control if (and how much) discount your customers receive when using an influencer's discount code.
-  Control which products influencers can earn sales commission from and/or; which products customers will receive discounts for.

## Can I set influencer specific commission rules?
Yes. You can [segment your influencers into groups](/merchant/influencer-group-specific-commission/) and configure promotion policy rules for each group separately.
