We've had quite a few merchants ask us how to integrate with other apps. We're going to start documenting integration set-ups here.

ReCharge
--------

To integrate with ReCharge, you'll need to ensure that ReCharge creates orders with the influencers discount code. You'll need to set this up manually for each ReCharge subscription using ReCharge.

Email marketing
----------------

**Mailchimp**

At present, we have 1st class integration with Mailchimp (my account > store settings > mailchimp). We will be adding other provides in the future.

**Other**

If your provider is not supported let us know. Otherwise, we have solved integration with 3rd party email solutions in a general way. All you need to do is export your referrers from [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) and import them into your email program of choice. See [/merchant/exporting-your-data](/merchant/exporting-your-data) for details on how to do this.
