We've designed [vwa.la](https://www.vwa.la) to make paying your influencer's their commission fast and simple.

We support multiple payment methods. You can pay influencer commission by **cash or in-store credit.** We also implement a number of security safeguards to ensure that you do not pay commissions on orders incorrectly.

**Supported cash payment methods**

*   Paypal
*   Manual bank account transfers

**Supported in-store credit payment methods**

*   Gift cards
*   Fixed price discount codes

PayPal
------

The simplest approach is to use our PayPal integration. PayPal provides the ability to pay multiple influencers in a single secure step.

**You can pay commission from either:**

*   The influencers table or;
*   An influencer's profile page or;
*   The orders table

**How do I pay a specific influencer?**

You can pay an influencer **all** of their unpaid commission from either:

1.  The table on the influencers page or;
2.  The orders table on the influencer's profile page

_Option 1_

*   Open the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) influencers page (left menu) to see a table of your influencers.
*   Select 1 or more influencers that you wish to pay.
*   From the actions menu, select "Pay by PayPal". Then in the payment form, ensure that the appropriate payment filter is selected and; click Yes to begin the payment.
*   You will then be forwarded to a PayPal page to complete the transaction. See below for more detail.

_Option 2_

*   Go to the influencer's profile page and scroll down to the orders table.
*   From the actions menu, select "Pay by PayPal" to open the payment form. If you have selected no orders, the payment form will be set up to pay out all unpaid commission for the influencer. Alternatively, you can select specific orders if you only wish to pay commission on those orders.

**How do I pay a influencer partially?**

You can **partially pay** unpaid order commission from either the orders page (left menu) or from the orders table on an influencer's profile page.

*   Open the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) orders page (left menu).
*   Select the orders you wish to pay
*   From the actions menu, select "Pay by PayPal". Then follow the steps in the popup window to initiate payment.

**How do I pay all?**

You can also pay all unpaid commission for all influencers from the table on the orders page.

*   Go to the orders page (left menu)  
    
*   Do not select any orders
*   From the actions menu, select "Pay all by PayPal" and complete the payment form.

**How to complete the PayPal payment form**

When you use the "Pay by PayPal" feature, [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) will automatically set up a PayPal payment and will forward you to PayPal. You will be prompted to log in to PayPal and approve the payment. Once the transaction is approved, your influencers will be notified of their payment via email (from both us and from PayPal) and the [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) dashboard will update with the payment status.

*   To cancel the payment, **DO NOT** **close the window**. Instead, click the cancel button on the PayPal payment form (the grey button in the screenshot below). Otherwise the order commission that was to be paid via the payment will be locked. This lock is automatically released after 24 hours.

**Important PayPal notes**

*   We pay influencers using the currency of your store.
*   If the payment does not transfer immediately, the recipient has 14 days to accept the payment before PayPal will reverse their payment and return funds to your account.
*   PayPal limits us to paying a maximum of 6 people at a time. This is a limitation that affects all users of PayPal's adaptive payments broker solution. To work around this issue, simply replay the "Pay all by PayPal" step until all influencers are paid. If you are making payments each month, this should not be an issue. For larger merchants, we are looking at implementing a PayPal per-approval step which will allow you to grant [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) the ability to automate payments from your PayPal account.

**Future PayPal improvements  
**We are working on adding an additional PayPal solution that will be opt-in for power users. It will allow you to delegate trust to [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) to pay out commission automatically on your behalf.

**What if the recipient (influencer) doesn't have a PayPal account?**  
This isn't an issue. PayPal payments will work even if the recipient does not have a PayPal account. The influencer will simply need to create a PayPal account using the same email address that they use for [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) to receive their payments.  
  
**What if the recipient's PayPal account is invalid/restricted?**  
We (and PayPal) will notify any influencer if their PayPal account is incomplete and requires their attention before PayPal will complete payment. Our orders feature will exclude paying out problematic influencers for 1 week after such an event. This means you can continue paying out other influencers whilst they fix their issue.  
  
**Are there fees? Who pays them?**  
PayPal transactions incur a small transaction fee. The fee will be incurred by the recipient (the influencer). We recommend that you communicate this with your influencers to avoid confusion.

**My PayPal transaction failed, PayPal says that I should verify my bank account...**  
PayPal takes security and fraud very seriously. If you see this message when trying to transfer money, you'll need to ensure that your bank account is linked to your PayPal account. This process is simple and is secure/safe. PayPal will make 2-3 small deposits into your bank account and will ask you to verify them. Once verified you'll be able to pay your influencers without issue.

[**Vwa.la**](http://Vwa.la) **says that my commission payment is pending, what does that mean?**  
If the influencer does not yet have a PayPal account, payments will be marked as pending. Once the influencer creates their PayPal account, they will claim your payment and the transaction will be marked as "paid".  
  
**I support multiple currencies, which one does** [**vwa.la**](http://vwa.la) **use?**  
Your store may allow for the user to change currency. However, Shopify only supports a single operating currency. This means that from Shopify's perspective, all products and customer orders are always in your operating currency. [Vwa.la](http://Vwa.la) only uses your operating currency when calculating commission calculations and making payments.

Cryptocurrency
-------------

We are investigating the potential of using Cryptocurrency to pay out influencer commission. If this is important to you, let us know!

Store credit (Gift Card)
------------------------

Alternatively you can choose to pay your influencers using Shopify gift cards.

*   This can be done in the exact same way that you pay via PayPal. Except you must choose the "Pay by Store Credit" option from the action menu. See the PayPal guide for details on setting up a commission payment.
*   It is important to note that you can only pay one influencer at a time with this feature.
*   Once you click the 'Pay by store credit' action, a payment form will appear. The payment form will display the total commission that will be paid. Shopify does not allow 3rd party applications to automatically create gift cards on your store's behalf. Therefore, you'll need to create a gift card or single use fixed amount discount code manually in your Shopify admin console for the displayed amount. Once you've created the gift card/code, you must copy and paste it into the payment form. Then click Yes.
*   [Vwa.la](http://Vwa.la) will then mark the affected orders as 'commission paid' and will send a notification to the influencer with their gift card information.

By Bank Account
---------------

Alternatively you can choose to pay your influencers manually using your bank account or another means of transfer.

**How do payments by bank account work?  
**The process of paying order commission manually using your bank account is the same as when paying by PayPal.

*   This can be done in the exact same way that you pay via PayPal. Except you must choose the "Pay by other" option from the action menu. See the PayPal guide for details on setting up a commission payment.
*   Once you click the 'Pay by other' action, a payment form will appear. Double check the payment filter then click Yes to complete the payment. This will immediately mark the orders as "commission paid" and will notify the affected influencers. You'll then need to handle the actual transfer of money yourself outside of [vwa.la.](http://vwa.la)

No commission payable message
-----------------------------

If there is no commission that can be paid at this time, you'll receive the following message. This message will display when:

*   There is no unpaid commission or;
*   Unpaid commission exists, but it belongs to orders that are unpaid by the customer, unfulfilled by you, younger than 30 days or do not meet your minimum commission payout criteria. (All of these commission rules can be disabled or customized via the commission rules section within my account > store settings).

![](/images/merchant/2019-02-02-16-53-50.png)

Payment rules / customization
------------------------------

To prevent incorrect payments, we will only allow you to pay commission on orders that are:

*   Paid
*   Fulfilled (delivered)
*   At least 30 days old (configurable via your [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) accounts page)

We also allow you to set rules that require influencers to have met the following minimum criteria before they are eligible to be paid:

*   Earned a minimum commission amount or;
*   Generated a minimum number of orders 

All of these rules can be customized via my account > store settings.   

**What about order changes, cancellations or refunds?**  
We track the life-cycle of your orders. This ensures that order changes (i.e. refunds / cancellations etc.) trigger re-calculations of influencer commissions.
