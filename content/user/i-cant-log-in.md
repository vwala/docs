#### I'm a merchant and I don't know my username/password

On install, we create a [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) account for you that uses the same email address as your Shopify store. We will send an email to that address with your user name (email) and password.

E.g.

#### I've forgotten my password, how do I change it?

You can reset your password from the login form. Simply select _"Don't remember your password?"_ and enter your email address. This will send an email to you with a reset password link. Click the link and then follow the instructions to reset your password.

#### My account is locked, how do I unlock it?

Please follow the instructions above (I.e. see the "I've forgotten my password, how do I change it?" section). If you still have issues, let us know via chat or email, we will reset your password for you asap.

#### Can I change my email address?

**If you're a merchant,** merchant's are not able to automatically change their email address. This limitation exists because it is important for us to keep your [vwa.la](http://vwa.la) account in sync with your shopify account. In the future we plan to relax this limitation. If this is an immediate issue, please contact us via chat or email.

**If you're an influencer,** you can change your email address from your My Account > User Settings page. Click the "pen" icon next to the email field and enter your new email twice. When you change your email, you will be automatically logged out. You will need to log back in using the new email address.
