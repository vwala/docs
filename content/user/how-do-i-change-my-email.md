## For Merchants

For the time being, we have disabled the ability to change your email address. This is largely to ensure that our merchant accounts stay in sync with your Shopify merchant account. We plan to relax this limitation soon.

## For Influencers

If you're an influencer, you can change your email address via the `My Account > User Settings` page. Click the `pen` icon next to the email field and enter your new email twice. When you change your email, you will be automatically logged out. You will need to log back in using the new email address.
