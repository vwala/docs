## How is my sales commission paid?

vwa.la allows stores to pay influencer commission using a variety of methods:

- By PayPal
- By store credit (single use, fixed amount discount code)
- By bank transfer 

To see which of these methods a store supports, please go to your dashboard's `link/code section` and see the `policy` column.

## Who pays me? vwa.la or the store?
The store will pay your commission via our software tools. We (vwa.la) do not have any visibility or influence over when/how commission is paid. The store uses our software to make commission payouts, according to their preferred payment method and schedule. For more guidance, please contact the store via their customer support email (or social media channels). The in-app support chat feature of your marketing dashboard (bottom right), is for vwa.la tech support only. Vwa.la tech support can only assist with general account questions.

## When is my sales commission paid?

To ensure that your commissions are always correct, we impose the following rules on a store before they can pay your commission:

- Your commission will not be paid for orders that have not been paid by the customer or fulfilled by the store (i.e. delivered to the customer) 
- Orders must be at least 30 days old (this is a default, each store has a different wait period).

The above constraints protect all parties from incorrect payments which, can occur due to customer refunds, changes or fraud.

## What if the order is cancelled?  
If the order is cancelled, commissions will not be paid. An order may be cancelled due to fraud, refund or incorrect use of vwa.la (i.e. self-orders, bots, link/code spamming).

## What is the difference between `commission owed` and `commission payable`?

Commission owed is the total unpaid commission that you have earned.

Commission payable is <= commission owed. It is the amount of unpaid commission that can be paid to you this time. It is based on the store's payment rules. I.e. referral orders must be paid and fulfilled and must be older than 30 days (to compensate for order refunds, cancellations etc).

## How do I setup PayPal with vwa.la?

You must:

- Ensure that your vwa.la email address is the same as your PayPal account (alternatively you can add your vwa.la email address to your PayPal account as a secondary email address if that suits you). 
- In PayPal, ensure that your PayPal account email is confirmed (verified)
- In PayPal, ensure that you have linked and verified a non-expired credit card or bank account to your PayPal account
- In PayPal, go to the `currencies` page and ensure that your account accepts the currency used by the store. 

To change your vwa.la email address, click your `profile picture` on the top right of the app and then click `my account`.

Once the above steps are complete, click the `check` button on the orange warning box that appears on your dashboard. The `check` button verification is performed by PayPal. All validation errors come directly from PayPal, not vwa.la - which means if your account verification fails, the source of the issue is with your PayPal account.

## Is PayPal required?

The majority of stores prefer to use PayPal. However the store may choose to pay you via bank transfer or via in store credit (i.e. single use fixed amount discount code). 

## What happens if a customer returns a product or changes their order?

We only allow commissions to be paid out for orders that have been fulfilled and are at least 30 days old. This prevents incorrect commission payments from being made. We also track the full life-cycle of orders. This means that we track order changes, refunds and cancellations so you can be assured that influencer rewards are always correctly calculated.
