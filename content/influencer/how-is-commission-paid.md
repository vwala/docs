## How is my sales commission paid?

Stores may pay your influencer commission using any of the following methods:

- By PayPal
- By store credit (single use, fixed amount discount code)
- By bank transfer 

To see which of these methods a store supports, please go to your dashboard's `link/code section` and see the `policy` column.

## Who pays me? vwa.la or the store?

- vwa.la does not pay your sales commission.
- You can't redeem your sales commission yourself.
- Stores will pay your commission, according to their preferred payment method and schedule. Vwa.la tech support can not advise the store's schedule or preferred payment method.

## When and how will I be paid?

- Stores will pay your commission, according to their preferred payment method and schedule. Vwa.la tech support can not advise the store's schedule or preferred payment method.
- You'll receive an email notification when the store pays your commission.
- If the store pays your commission by store credit, then you will receive an email with a store credit code (single use, fixed amount) that you can use in the store's checkout on your next order. Because this is a single use code that can't be combined with other codes, you should use the full amount in the checkout.
- If the store pays your commission by PayPal, then funds will be transferred from the store's PayPal account to your PayPal account. 
   - If you do not have a PayPal account, then you must create one. Otherwise you will not be payable. 
   - Your PayPal account must have a verified email and must accept the store's currency. It must also have a linked and verified credit card or bank account attached. 
   - Your vwa.la account email, must be the same as your PayPal email address. Alternatively, you can add your vwa.la account's email address as a secondary email to your PayPal account. You can change your vwa.la account's email address via your account settings page (click the top right menu button of the app to open your account settings page). 
   - If your account has PayPal setup issues then your dashboard will show an orange warning message, with instructions that you can follow to fix your PayPal setup. The warning message has a `check` button, that you can use to request PayPal's service to validate your vwa.la email address. All warnings are from PayPal's verification service.
- We (vwa.la) do not have any visibility or influence over when/how commission is paid. 
- If you have waited longer than 30 days to recieve your commission, please contact the store via their customer support (their website or social media channels). The in-app support chat feature of your marketing dashboard (bottom right) is for vwa.la tech support (who can't assist with a commission payouts, but can assist with general user questions/issues).

## What is the difference between `commission owed` and `commission payable`?

Your dashboard's overview table has two columns - `commission owed` and `commission payable`. 

Commission owed is the total unpaid commission that you have earned.

`Commission payable` is less than or equal to your `commission owed` amount. It is the amount of unpaid commission that can be paid to you this time. It is based on the store's payment rules. 

## What are `commission payment rules` and how do they affect the commission that I am owed?

When commission is earned, it is not immediately payable. Commission earned is only payable when it meets the store's payment rules. 

Example payment rules:

- You can not be paid commission on any referral order that a) has not been paid by the customer and b) has not been fulfilled by the store (i.e. delivered to the customer) 
- You can not be paid commission on any referral order that is less than 30 days old
- Stores may customise the above rules. They may also have additional rules (e.g. minimium referral orders or minimum commission earned). To see the most up to date information, please go to your vwa.la dashboard and see the `overview table > commission payable` column and view the column's tooltip. This tooltip includes a summary of their commission payment rules.

`Commission owed` that meets the above criteria, is considered to be `commission payable`. The `commission owed` and `commission payable` statistics on your dashboard are updated 1-2 times a day.

Why have commission payment rules? Commission payment rules ensure that you receive the correct amount of commission (i.e. factoring in customer refunds, changes or fraud).


## What if my referral order is cancelled or changed?  
If the order is cancelled, commissions will be cancelled as well. An order may be cancelled due to fraud, refund or incorrect use of vwa.la (i.e. self-orders, bots, coupon site link/code listing/spamming).

If an order is changed, commission will be updated to reflect the new order net total (total minus discounts, taxes)

## What happens if a customer returns a product or changes their order?

We only allow commissions to be paid out for orders that have been fulfilled and are at least 30 days old. This prevents incorrect commission payments from being made. We also track the full life-cycle of orders. This means that we track order changes, refunds and cancellations so you can be assured that influencer rewards are always correctly calculated.
