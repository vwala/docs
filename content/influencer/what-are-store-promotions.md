What is a store promotion?
--------------------------

A promotion is the same as a _sales campaign_ but instead of being specific to a store's customers, it applies to their influencers_._ That's you :)  
  
A promotion defines:

*   The commission an influencer will earn when a lead\* makes an order using the influencer's discount code or link. \*A lead is a customer who the influencer brought to the store.
*   The discount that a customer will receive when they make an order using a influencer's discount code or link.
*   Any rules that may affect the influencer's commission. E.g. whether the influencer will earn commission only on specific products or if the order value exceeds a minimum amount.
