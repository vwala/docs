In vwa.la you will earn sales commission on all non-personal orders that are created using either your influencer link or discount code.

Where is my influencer link / code?
-----------------------------------

When you join a store's influencer marketing program, you'll be issued a unique referral link and discount code. You can find both your link and discount code on the vwa.la > Home page, within the Discount Codes / Links table.

To copy the influencer link or code, click the appropriate _copy icon (square shape)_ in the table. You can then paste your copied link/code elsewhere.**  
  
Why is my account pending, approved or revoked?**

You account (and it's discount code and link) can only be used if your account status is active.

*   **Pending:** If your account status pending  this means that your account is pending approval by the store. Please wait for the store to approve your account before using your code or link. Once approved, you will be notified by email.
*   Note: Some stores require you to link your preferred social media account (i.e. that will be used for marketing) before your account will be approved. You should do this on sign-up to fast track the approval process. It is important to note that vwa.la only stores limited information about you - specifically, we only store your social media username and your average # of posts, comments and reactions within the last 30 days)
*   **Cancelled\\Revoked:** If the status is cancelled, the store has cancelled your discount code / link.
*   **Approved**: You're ready to start marketing and earning!

How do I create product specific influencer links?
--------------------------------------------------

You can create a product specific influencer link, by adding the following to any product URL from a store. E.g.

**Collection specific**  
[https://www.nipandfab.com.au/collections/teen-skin-fix?ac=**MYCODE**](https://www.nipandfab.com.au/collections/teen-skin-fix?ac=MYCODE)

**Product specific**  
[https://www.nipandfab.com.au/collections/teen-skin-fix/products/teen-skin-fix-zero-shine-moisturiser?ac=**MYCODE**](https://www.nipandfab.com.au/collections/teen-skin-fix/products/teen-skin-fix-zero-shine-moisturiser?ac=MYCODE)

So if your influencer discount code was sarah, replace _?ac=MYCODE_ with _?ac=sarah_.

How do I earn commission?
-------------------------

Sales commission is credited to you when:

*   A customer completes an order using your influencer link or;
*   A customer completes an order using your influencer discount code

**How does link tracking work?**  
We use cookies, local storage and IP matching to track your influencer leads. These trackers exist for 30 days and then expire. This is consistent with the majority of influencer marketing products on the market today.

**When someone clicks my link is my influencer code added to their cart?**  
Yes, your influencer discount code is automatically added to the customers' cart when they click your influencer link. This approach simplifies their shopping experience and increases your conversion rate.

**Does the customer receive a discount when using my influencer discount code?**  
Yes, the customer will receive a discount when they use your influencer discount code. The exact amount is set by the store. Check the vwa.la > Promotions page for the customer discount (%) value.

How is my commission calculated?
---------------------------------

In vwa.la each store will have one or more influencer promotions. These are like sales promotions but for influencers. Each promotion will define its own influencer commission policy. I.e. If you sell product X you get 15% commission on orders containing X. For every promotion that you join, you will be given a unique, personalised influencer link and discount code. This allows us to track your promotion specific performance and ensure that you earn the correct commission.

When an order is received, we correlate it to a specific promotion. We use the commission rules that the store has specified for that promotion to calculate your commission. Commissions are calculated on the pre-tax and shipping value of the order minus any customer discounts. If an order is refunded or changed, your commission will be re-calculated based on the new value.

E.g.

*   Your influencer commission is 10%.
*   When customers use your influencer code, they get a 20% discount.
*   You've referred Sarah from Instagram and she has created an order with the store worth $80 ($100 before discount). This amount does not include taxes / shipping.
*   Your commission is calculated as 10% of $80. Which is $8.

How can I track my commission?
------------------------------

You can view all orders that your influencer account has generated from the vwa.la > Orders page. From this page, you'll be able to see:

*   The order you created
*   The order's value
*   The order's status
*   Your commission (amount owed / paid)

How is my sales commission paid?
--------------------------------

vwa.la allows stores to pay influencer commission using a variety of methods:

*   By PayPal
*   By store credit (gift card or single use discount code)
*   By bank transfer 

They may choose any of these methods when paying your sales commission. Please see the stores' terms and conditions on their website for details. Alternatively, contact the store directly via their website contact details.

When is my sales commission paid?
---------------------------------

To ensure that your commissions are always correct, we impose the following rules on a store before they can pay your commission:

*   Your commission will not be paid for orders that have not been paid by the purchaser or fulfilled by the store (i.e. the transaction payment must have been cleared and the product must have been delivered)
*   Orders must be at least 30 days old (this is a default, each store has a different wait period).

The above constraints protect all parties from incorrect payments which, can occur due to customer refunds, changes or fraud.

**What if the order is cancelled?**  
If the order is cancelled, commissions will not be paid. An order may be cancelled due to fraud, refund or incorrect use of vwa.la (i.e. self-orders, bots, link/code spamming).

**Who pays me?** [**vwa.la**](https://vwa.la) **or the store?**  
The store will pay you via vwa.la, using their chosen payment method.

**How do I tell** [**vwa.la**](https://vwa.la) **which PayPal account to use?**

Simply make sure that your vwa.la email address is the same as your PayPal account. You can also add your vwa.la email address to an existing PayPal account if that suits you.

**Is PayPal required?**

No, the store can choose to pay you via bank transfer or via in store credit (i.e. gift card, fixed amount discount code).

**What happens if a customer returns a product or changes their order?**

We only allow commissions to be paid out for orders that have been fulfilled and are at least 30 days old. This prevents incorrect commission payments from being made. We also track the full life-cycle of orders. This means that we track order changes, refunds and cancellations so you can be assured that influencer rewards are always correctly calculated.
