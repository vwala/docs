### How to join a store's marketing program

If you're interested in joining the store, click the 'view website or join' link. You can find the form to join the store's marketing program on their website.

### What is rank? (i.e. A-E ratings)

Each store has a rank. A rank is a relative score used to compare different stores. It is a live score that changes over time. It is based on a store's marketing performance within vwa.la and factors in variables such as:

- The number of influencers
- The number of influencer leads and orders per influencer
- The average yield per influencer

You should not use the rank exclusively when choosing a store to promote. All of our brands have great products and sales potential. The rank can however be a useful indicator of their performance within vwa.la to date.
