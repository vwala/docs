In this release, we have:

* [Beta] dark mode support
* Improved our influencer search feature (free text search is now combined with filters for more flexibility and simplicity)
* We have successfully finished our quarterly security audit. This is when we block off time to focus on reviewing our security design, ensuring that there are no vulnerabilities. 
* Added SEMVER version tracking. This is the start of a body of work, that will allow us to better communicate releases in-app.
* Minor content and UX improvements to our documents site
* Upgraded various software libraries (internationalisation, type compiler) that give us greater code quality and new capabilities. 
* Fixed a minor issue with the date ranger picker UI
* Upgraded our store theme colour picker
* The influencer table now hides suspended influencer accounts by default. You can enable this via the table's search feature (top right)

Thankyou to everyone who has contributed feedback via our in-app chat. As always, product feedback and ideas are very welcome. Happy marketing!
