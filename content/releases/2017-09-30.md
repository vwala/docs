Another solid release from the team, thanks all for the support and feedback.

* We've made great progress on improving our social media integration, you will soon be able to capture a referrer's facebook / instagram identity during sign-up. This will greatly improve your ability to review new referrers and quantify their market reach / synergy. 
* We've invested more time this week into improving our documentation, especially for referrers. We want to make vwa.la as simple to use as possible, so we will continue to invest in this area.
* You can now cancel referral orders. This will void the referrer commission associated with the order, but does not cancel the order itself.
* We've optimised our stats engine to be even more efficient in some edge cases.
* Referrer's can now change their username and email address through My Account
