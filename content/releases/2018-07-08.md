Hi all,

Soon we we will be releasing our in-app messaging solution. As of yet, only a few early adopter merchants have been given access. Our goal is to test it thoroughly to ensure it's ready for your use.

**Beta features**  
Features include:

* The ability to message your referrers - either individually or as a group
* The ability to attach media
* The ability to see the referrer's online presence and which messages they've read
* The ability to edit / delete messages after they've been sent.

**Future releases**  
The first release will include only essential features. We will evolve the solution to be more sophisticated over time with your feedback.

**Don't want to use our in-app messaging?**  
No problem, you can always sync your referrers to your preferred email program by exporting them from the referrers menu.
