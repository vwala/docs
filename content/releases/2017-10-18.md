For this release, we've made some important improvements to our referrer management.

[Vwa.la](http://Vwa.la) now:

*   Captures a referrers name on sign-up. We will soon capture their social media account info too.
*   You can now export your referrer contact info, useful for email base marketing (i.e. Mailchimp) or for communicating with your referrers (i.e. via gmail).
*   We've made some improves to paging referrers
*   We now track your billing plan changes over time. This means that our invoice calculation is now accurate to the day-level instead of the month level.
*   We've improving the affiliate on-boarding messaging to ensure that our help documentation is ever more visible.

Thanks all for the feedback. We will start incorporating your feedback asap :)
