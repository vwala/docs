For this release we've focused on making improvements to our user experience.  
  
What's new:

* New product page and pricing tables.
* We've greatly improved the usability of the product on mobile devices. This is important as 60% of referrers interact with apps using their phones.

We're really happy with the new look and we hope you enjoy it too. If you have any feedback, let us know :)
