In this release we've:

* Upgraded our referrer promotions feature so that both fixed price customer discounts and referrer sales commission is supported. Please be careful when using these features, you don't want to overpay referrer commission or give away customer discounts that are too generous. If you are unsure, please stay with % based commission/discounts for now.
* Improved our FAQ customer support bot. This bot will help reduce our support overheads so that we can focus more of our energy on delivering product improvements.
* We've also started work on our new user on-boarding wizard / check-list which we hope will make setting up vwa.la even easier for new starters.

Thanks all for your feedback. Have a great easter.
