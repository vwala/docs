Hi all, in this release:

## For merchants

- You can now customise the emails that we send to your influencers when their account is approved, rejected, suspended or restored. This is done via `my account > store settings > email templates`. 
- We have made a number of quality improvements to our statistics engine. Large merchants should no longer experience regeneration delays.
- You can now see your influencer's total followers on the influencer table and on the stats overview page (market reach filter)
- We have made a number of performance and resiliancy improvements to our in-store launcher
- We have made many improvements to our PayPal edge case handling and we now ensure that recipients not only have a valid, verified PayPal account, but an account that accepts your store's currency. We have improved our messaging to influencers as well to make it easier for them to fix their issues. 
- You can now rename an influencer's code from the influencer table
- You can now specify which commission payment methods you support. This helps us manage communication/expectations with your influencer team more effectively.
