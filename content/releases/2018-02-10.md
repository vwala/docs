Hi all, in this release we have:

* Added the ability for referrers to change their referrer code. This can be done from the homepage of their dashboard (i.e. discount code/link section).
* We've updated our dashboard charts to now show you "sales" and "earnings". So you can easily see a summary of your income and expenses (commission paid/owed)
* We've added the ability to filter orders by date. Thanks Tom for the feedback.
* We've also reduced the size of the vwa.la web application by 25%! We'll continue to make vwa.la as small and fast loading as possible.

Keep the feedback coming!
