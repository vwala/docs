For this release we have:

*   Made various improvements to our PayPal integration which will make managing PayPal payments much simpler
*   Added the ability for merchants to bulk remove referrers
*   Reduced the file size of our in-store widget code (even faster loading)

Thanks all for the feedback. We will start incorporating your feedback asap :)
