Hi all, in this release:

- Added the ability to export your leads to CSV
- Added product (line item) information to the orders export
- You can now configure your influencer links, so that influencer discount codes are not automatically populated into the customer's cart. To use this setting, go to your `promotion policy` page and customise your influencer link behaviour rules
- We have added support for Youtube channels with customer URLs. I.e. youtube.com/c/custom_url
- We have completely re-implemented our client side form technology. This has allowed us to remove a few form side effects that in some situations lead to unexpected behaviour. We have also added a lot more tests to our client side technology to ensure we maintain software quality in future releases
- More optimisations to our stats technology
