Hi all, happy new year!

In this release, we have:

*   We've made some signficiant improvements to our payment UX. Payments now include richer filters, previews, receipts and many small improvements / simplications. 
*   We've added influnecer group specific signup/invite links. This means you can now create custom, on-brand links to onboard influencers to specific groups. 
*   We've improved our white-label support by adding 1) brand subdomain URLs (i.e. yourstorename.vwa.la) and 2) branded inbound URLs (i.e. all URLs within our email that reference you store, are now white label and forward users to your store front instead of our website). 
*   Added Korean and Japanese language support.
*   We have made significant improvements to our in-app messaging solution
*   Minor improvements to our homepage
*   In beta, we have a new promotion implementation that will make promotion policy changes for large clients much faster.
*   In beta, we have a new distributed event system that will allow us to handle millions of lead/order events per second. 

Thanks all for the feedback. If you need anything let us know :)
