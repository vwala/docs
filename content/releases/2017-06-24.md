This week we've focused on improving a few technical things that are necessary to ensure [vwa.la](https://vwa.la) users' can expect a great experience.  
  
What's new:

*   We've optimised the download size of the application. This means you can expect faster download times and a more responsive mobile experience.
*   We've also greatly improved the usability of the product on mobile devices and XL screens.
*   We take security and performance very seriously. We've spent the last two weeks implementing countless improvements and additional security checks to ensure that [vwa.la](https://vwa.la) is fast and secure.

Thanks to all of the user's who shared their ideas / experiences with us. If you have any feedback, let us know :)
