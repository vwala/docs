In this release:

*   We've added the ability for merchants to write notes against each referrer.
*   Added pagination and sorting to the referrer codes page
*   Improved the user friendliness of messages from PayPal
*   Optimised the orders table to handle large amounts of data

We've also made major improvements to our backend:

*   Upgraded our backed server technology to improve the overall performance of [vwa.la](http://vwa.la)
*   Heavily optimised our database queries and background tasks

Thanks all for your feedback. Happy marketing :)
