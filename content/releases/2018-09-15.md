Hey guys,

We've had another set of productive weeks here at vwa.la making various software customization and quality fixes.

*   You can now disable the marketplace.
*   Overview stats on the stats page now include tool tips to show exact values
*   We've optimized the performance of the referrer orders table
*   You can now disable IP order tracking. This means that only orders with discount codes will be tracked.
*   We have added a new column to the orders table that will indicate which method was used to track the referral order (link / code for now, later we'll add SKU tracking)
*   We've added additional checks to our anti-fraud solution.
*   We've added additional optimizations to our stats engine to ensure we stay ahead of your growth. 
*   We've added order tagging and customer tagging. This will help you filter orders and customers in your shopify admin console.
*   Improved our marketplace category algorithm.
*   Fixed an issue where navigating between multiple stores within a single vwa.la account would not update the logo/store selector to show the presently selected store.
*   Added many new tests to our test suite to ensure we have excellent test coverage.
