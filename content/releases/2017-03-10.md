For this release, we've added some polish to our promotions feature. You can now:

*   Set a minimum spend amount per promotion. This means that when a customer uses a referrer code, the customer discount will not apply unless their order is greater than or equal to a minimum amount.
*   You can now constrain the base promotion so that customer discounts only apply to purchases that include items from a specific product collection(s).
*   When adding a new promotion to your referral marketing program, we automatically populate a reward rule for your default referrer group.
*   You can now permanently delete a promotion.
*   We have optimised our referrer group logic to handle adding larger volumes of groups. We have also optimised many of our back-end processes to ensure we can handle larger merchants easily.
*   And last but not least, we have added UTM tags to all referrer links. This will ensure that automatically get better vwa.la reporting in Google Analytics.

As always thanks for the feedback :)
