Whats new:

* Promotions can now be restricted to a specific referrer(s) of your choice. A great use of this feature is creating special promotions exclusive to your store's VIP influencers. E.g. for a high profile influencer, you may wish to give them a more generous commission. You can also choose to apply a product / collection filter to your promotion to focus your influencer on selling specific stock.
* We've also been hard at work adding more tutorials to our knowledge base. We have a range of guides for both [merchants](/merchant) and [referrers](/influencer) to help make you guys more successful.

Details for the technical:

* Lots of improvements to how we manage promotions at scale for larger stores.
* We've also upgraded our databases and servers to give us more capacity as we continue to grow.
