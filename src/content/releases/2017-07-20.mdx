This week we've focused on making the vwa.la UX branded and configurable.

## What's new

**Sign-up widget improvements**  
The in-store sign-up widget can now be turned off or re-positioned. This can be done from your vwa.la dashboard (My accounts > store settings)

**Branded sign-up pages!**  
You can also brand your referrer sign-up form. You can configure this feature from your vwa.la dashboard (My accounts > store settings).

## What's next?

**Referrer specific promotions  
**Our next release will focus on improving [promotions](/merchant/promotions) (sales campaigns for your referrers). Previously we introduced product/collection specific promotions to help focus your referrer's selling efforts. In this release we will be introducing referrer specific promotions, which is a powerful way of grouping referrers into different reward structures (i.e. VIP influencers).

Thanks everyone for the great product feedback, if there is anything you'd like to see implemented let us know :)
