In this release, we have:

* Dark mode support (beta) with improved thematic support. You can enable it via `my account > store settings > theme`
* You can manually give commission to an influencer, by tagging an order with the following syntax: `commission:the_influencer_code_here`. Order tags can be created via your Shopify web admin or POS software.
* Improved our influencer search feature (free text search is now combined with filters for more flexibility and simplicity). We will expand our search and mapping visualisation capability in future releases.
* The influencer table now hides suspended influencer accounts by default. You can enable this via the table's search feature (top right)
* The payments page has a new report (`actions > export > tax history`). This report aggegrates commission paid to each influencer by fiscal year. Allowing you to get a summary for your tax reporting.
* We have successfully finished our quarterly security audit. This is when we block off time to focus on reviewing our security design, ensuring that there are no vulnerabilities. 
* Support latest verison of Tiktok API
* Unused influencer groups are now automatically removed after 14 days of inactivity. 
* Klaviyo: We now remove suspended accounts from your Klaviyo list, instead of marking them as unsubscribed
* There is now a `share code` feature on each influencer's profile page (code section). You can use this to create ad-hoc product specific influencer links. It is a way to override the default influencer link behaviour (that is defined on your `promotion policy` page)
* Added SEMVER version tracking. This is the start of a body of work, that will allow us to better communicate releases in-app.
* Minor content and UX improvements to our documents site
* Upgraded various software libraries (internationalisation, type compiler) that give us greater code quality and new capabilities. 
* Fixed a minor issue with the date ranger picker UI
* Upgraded our store theme colour picker
