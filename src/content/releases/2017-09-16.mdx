We're excited to announce that we have released a new version of vwa.la with gift card support! This means you can now pay your referrer's their commission with a Shopify gift card. You can read more about this feature [here](/merchant/paying-commission).

We've also made some improvements to our user account management features. Referrer's can now change their user name and email address.

Thanks to all who've given their feedback this week.
