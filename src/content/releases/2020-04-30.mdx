In this release, we have been working hard to provide the following new features:

## For merchants

* You can now add a custom T&Cs approval checkbox to your influencer sign up page. All you need to do is add the URL of your T&Cs page to `customise > signup page > T&CS URL`. 
* We have added TikTok integration!
* For our beta customers who are presently using the new promotion policy features, we have added a new rule that automatically cleans up inactive influencers (based on your preferences).
* We have improved the in-store widget UX by making it more minimal (removed the header on larger screens).
* We have improved the `customise` page UX by making it better organised and by improving the rendering speed.

## For influencers 

* We have improved the influencer marketplace. The marketplace UX is now mobile responsive and better promotes your brand through product images and higher resolution thumbnails. 
* Influencers can now quickly join your marketing program from the marketplace (by viewing your store's marketplace profile) or via their dashboard (by entering your URL). The entire `add store` UX has been improved and made more intuitive. 
 
Thanks all for the feedback. If you need anything let us know :)
