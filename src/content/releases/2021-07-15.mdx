Hi all, in this release:

- You can now customise the commission tracker's priority (i.e. if a referral order maps to 2 different influencers by both code and link click, you can now specify which influencer is given commission). This is set up via `customise > commission tracking rules`. 
- Added the ability to export your leads to CSV
- Added product (line item) information to the orders export
- You can now configure your influencer links, so that influencer discount codes are not automatically populated into the customer's cart. To use this setting, go to your `promotion policy` page and customise the influencer link behaviour settings of some/all of your influencer/group rules.
- We have added support for Youtube channels with customer URLs. I.e. youtube.com/c/custom_url
- Product/collection/page searches now support partial/wildcard matches
- We have completely re-implemented our client side form technology. This has allowed us to remove a few side effects that in some situations caused unexpected behaviour within forms. We have also added a lot more tests to our client side technology to ensure we maintain software quality in future releases. 
- More optimisations to our stats technology (reduced store/bandwidth needs)
- Refactored the email template editing form to have better error handling
- Lots of small improvements to form validation and tooltip messages
