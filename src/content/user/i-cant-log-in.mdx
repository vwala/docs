## I don't know my username/password

**For merchants**: On install, we created a vwa.la account for you that uses the same email address as your Shopify admin account. We sent an email to that address with your user name (email) and password.

#### How do I reset my password?

You can reset your password from the [login page](https://www.vwa.la/#/login). Select the `forgot your password?` link at bottom of the login form and then enter your email address. We will email you your new password.

Please follow the instructions above.
