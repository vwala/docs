## Install

vwa.la can be quickly installed in two ways:

- From the Shopify app store [https://apps.shopify.com/vwala](https://apps.shopify.com/vwala) or;
- From the our [merchant signup page.](https://www.vwa.la/#/s/create)

During installation, we ask that you select a billing plan.

### Billing Plan

The final step is to choose a billing plan. We offer a 14 day free trial. Don't worry so much about choosing the right sized plan, you can upgrade/downgrade or even cancel your plan at any point. To read more about our pricing, please see our [pricing tables](https://www.vwa.la/#/pricing).

## Uninstall

### Taking a break 
To pause your vwa.la account, you can contact us, or you can simply update your `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section so that your influencers receive $0 or 0% commission on orders.

### Full uninstall
You can uninstall vwa.la at anytime using your Shopify admin console (apps section). This will disable your influencer marketing program and cancel your billing. We'll let your influencers know too, that way they are aware that their links / codes will no longer be usable and that they should stop their marketing activity. 

## Re-install

Should you wish to re-install vwa.la at a later time, you can follow the same steps outlined in the installation section above. Re-installing vwa.la will restore your accounts data and re-activate your influencer marketing program's promotions, links and discount codes.
