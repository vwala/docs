## Your branding

You can change the logo and primary colour of your vwa.la dashboard, in-store signup page and sign-up page.

![](../../images/merchant/2019-01-20-08-55-22.png)

**The Logo image** must be a URL. We recommend that you re-use the logo from your store page that is being hosted by [http://cdn.shopify.com.](http://cdn.shopify.com) To get the URL, go to your store page and right-click on your logo image. Then copy and paste the URL into the vwa.la `customise` page. You will see a preview if successful. Make sure you prefix the URL with http:// or https://.

**The primary color** must be a dark color as white text will be displayed on top of it. It will be used in both the sign-up page and the launcher's 'call to action' button. To find your colour, you can use [http://www.color-hex.com/.](http://www.color-hex.com/)

And here are the results!

### Variant: Themed In-store signup page (embedded in your store)

## Signup page launcher button

When you install vwa.la, we automatically install our in-store signup page launcher into your store front. This is to help you quickly set up a way to promote your influencer marketing program to potential influencers. When someone clicks the launcher, your influencer signup/login page will appear. The launcher is optional and configurable. You can:

- Enable/disable it on either desktop/mobile devices
- Change it's position and;
- customise it's text

**My changes are not visible?**
It can take a few minutes before your launcher changes are applied. Please wait a few minutes and then refresh your store page. You will need to clear your browser cache to see the changes.

**Are there any alternatives to using the launcher?**
Yes. You can disable the launcher on desktop/mobile devices and then instead [add a Shopify Page to your store.](/merchant/adding-a-page-to-your-store)

## Email templates

In this section, you can customise the email templates that we send to your influencers.

![](../../images/merchant/2019-01-20-09-07-03.png)

Our templates support variables as well as HTML tags (i.e. you can embed images, gifs, bold text etc). Below are a few examples that may be useful.

**Adding images**

```

**Adding video**

The best solution to adding video to your email templates, is to simply include the video URL as plain text. This is because the majority of email programs (i.e. gmail, outlook) do not support video in email. [Read more here](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/a_how_to_guide_to_embedding_html5_video_in_email/). If you wish to use HTML to embed your video regardless, then the following example is your best approach - it will render a fallback image if your video is blocked.

```
<video src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4" width="320" height="176" controls>
    <a href="https://yourwebsite.com" >
        <img src="https://www.emailonacid.com/images/blog_images/Emailology/2013/html5_video/bunny-fallback.jpg" height="176" width="320" />
    </a>
</video>
```
