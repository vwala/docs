Each influencer is given a unique, personalised link and discount code to your store. We've compiled a FAQ guide to help you understand how they work.

## What happens when a lead clicks on a referral link?

-  The lead will be sent to your store (I.e. either your home page or a product/collection page (see below))
-  We track the lead using a 30 day tracking cookie in their browser.
-  The lead's shopping cart will be pre-filled with the influencer's discount code. Note: If the lead makes a purchase and doesn't use the discount code and; that purchase was made within the 30 day cookie tracking window, then the order will still be rewarded to the influencer.
-  We update our statistics and notify both the merchant and influencer of the lead event

## Can influencer links go to a specific product / collection?

Yes they can. You can configure this behaviour for all influencers, using your `promotion policy` rules page. You will want to set the link behavour rule for each influencer group accordingly.

Influencers can also create ad-hoc product/collection specific links. This is useful when they want to promote a specific product in their marketing. For information on how this is done, please see the influencer guide's tutorial on [creating product or collection specific links](/influencer/how-do-i-earn-commission/#product-specific).

## Can I change the cookie tracking time window?

Yes. You can change this setting in [vwa.la.](https://vwa.la) Go to my account > store settings.

## If a customer clicks 2 different links from different influencers, do both influencers get commission if that customer makes an order?

No. Only the the influencer who created the last lead is paid sales commission.
