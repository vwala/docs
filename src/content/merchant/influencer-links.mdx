When an influencer joins your marketing team, they are given a unique, personalised link and discount code. They can use either of these to promote your store/products.

## How do i customise the behaviour of influencer links/codes?

You can configure how your influencers' links/codes work, via the `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section.

## What happens when a lead clicks on a referral link?

- A lead is a potential customer who has clicked on an influencer's link
- [Customisable] When a lead clicks on an influencer's link, they will be sent to your store (you can configure where they are sent, i.e. to your home page or a product/collection page (see below))
- [Customisable] We track the lead using a 30 day tracking cookie in their browser.
- [Customisable] The lead's shopping cart will be pre-filled with the influencer's discount code. Note: If the lead makes a purchase and doesn't use the discount code and; that purchase was made within the 30 day cookie tracking window, then the order will still be rewarded to the influencer.
- We update our statistics and notify both the merchant and influencer of the lead event

## Can influencer links go to a specific product/collection?

Yes they can. You can configure this behaviour for all influencers, via the `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section. If you have multiple groups, you will want to set the link behavour rule for each influencer group as required.

Influencers can also create ad-hoc product/collection specific links. Their dashboard has a `link/code` section with a `share` button that they can use to create product/collection specific influencer links. We document the URL format for such links in more detail within the user guide that is targetted at `influencer` users ([creating product or collection specific links](/influencer/how-do-i-earn-commission/#product-specific)).

## How do I customise how links/codes work?

You can customise the following settings, via your `customise page > commission tracking rules` section.

- Enable/disable code based commission tracking. Enabled by default.
- Enable/disable link based commission tracking. Enabled by default.
- Specify the duration (days) of the lead tracking time window. 30 days by default.
- Limit commission to new customers only. Disabled by default.
- Allow/deny your influencer to earn commission from their own personal orders. Not allowed by default.
- Coupon site policy. Specify whether influencers are allowed to share their codes on coupon sites. Not allowed by default.

## If a customer clicks 2 different links from different influencers, do both influencers get commission if that customer makes an order?

No. Only the the influencer who created the last lead is paid sales commission.
