Congratulations on joining our influencer marketing program. This article is here to help you get started!

## What is an influencer?

An influencer (also known as an affiliate or referrer) is a person who promotes a brand to their audience and affects the audience's purchasing decisions. An influencer is able to do this through their authority, knowledge or relationship with their audience.

Being an influencer can be rewarding. If you refer someone to a store and they then make a purchase, you will be paid a sales commission by the store. The sales commission will be a % of the total order value (minus any customer discounts, shipping and taxes)

## Benefits of being an influencer

- It's free to join
- Earn income from your existing social network
- Support the brands and products that you love
- Receive exclusive access to referrer only offers and promotions

## What do I do as an influencer?

When you join a store's influencer marketing program, you will be issued a unique, personalised link and discount code for that store. Your job is to use your link or code to promote the store's brand and products via your website, blog or social media channel(s). You can do this in many ways, for example:

- Posting your personal content that promotes the brand's products
- Creating product review blogs or vlogs. E.g. a Youtube review
- Sharing the store's posts or ads (with your link/code included)
- Word of mouth marketing

## What should I NOT do as an influencer?

Our system automatically monitors all usage of influencer links and codes and red-flags incorrect usage. Sales commission on orders that were created under any of the following scenarios will be voided. We reserve the right to cancel your account without notice should you violate any of these conditions.  
  
You should not:

- Use Bots to generate leads. 
- Spam social media groups / channels
- Post your influencer code on coupon websites and;
- Buy products using your influencer discount code. **Note:** most stores don't accept this behaviour, however a few do. Check each store's terms and conditions or reach out to the store directly via their customer support (via their web page) to confirm.
