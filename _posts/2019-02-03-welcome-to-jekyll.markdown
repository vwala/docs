# Referral/affiliate/influencer marketing mean the same thing

**Written by Daniel**

Yep, that's right. Referral/affiliate/influencer marketing mean the same thing. The industry just hasn't decided which term works the best. So, when you add a page to your store introducing your marketing program, simply choose whichever term suits your brand the best!
