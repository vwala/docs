## Can I have multiple stores?

If you have multiple shopify stores with the vwa.la app installed to each, you can manage them all from a single vwa.la login. For technical and billing reasons, each Shopify store will require a unique install of the vwa.la app.

To manage multiple Shopify stores from a single vwa.la login, you must ensure that each Shopify store's admin email uses the same email address. With this approach, you can view/manage each of your stores individually by toggling between them in the app menu.

## I have multiple stores, can I use a single vwa.la install to manage both?

Please see `Can I have multiple stores?` above. You may wish to considered a single shopify store approach instead. A single shopify store, can support different URLs (top level or subdomain) and different currencies. This approach will reduce your maintenance complexity and reduce your shopify plan / app costs.
