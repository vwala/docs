In this release we've focused on improving some of our core features.

**What's new?**

* Merchant's can now opt for all of their referrer codes to be limited to a single use per customer (`customise > business rules`)
* We've increased our PayPal payment time out window from 1 day to 15 days
* Improved our support of partially fulfilled orders
* Made it clear that all billing plan prices are in USD
* Fixed an issue with Mobile Safari 10.x not displaying correctly

Thanks all for your feedback :)
