Hi all, in this release:

## For merchants

- We have upgraded our store credit commission payment feature. You can now pay commission by store credit to more than 1 Influencer at a time and; we automatically create single use, fixed amount discounts for them to use in your checkout. Previously this had to be done manually per Influencer.
- We have added Twitch support
- You can now customise the terminology used to describe your marketing team. Influencers, ambassadors or affiliates
- Influencers can now disabled email notifications
- We've made more upgrades to our new promotion policy feature
- Exporting your Influencers, now includes their social media account info
- Merchants can now manage their Influencer's details (name, email, password, social media accounts)
- Various UX enhancements to the sign up page
- Removed support for IE10
- We now consistently display the billing plan comparison matrix and FAQ info on all billing plan pages
- We now automatically clean up stale Influencers acccounts (no login, no leads, no orders and older than 180 days)
- We now tell Influencers if their email address is bouncing.

## For influencers

- Major improvements to the join store flow. You no longer need to log back in to see your store changes.
- Major improvements to the delete account / delete store flow
