These are like sales promotions but for influencers. Each promotion will define its own influencer commission policy. I.e. If you sell product X you get 15% commission on orders containing X. For every promotion that you join, you will be given a unique, personalised influencer link and discount code. This allows us to track your promotion specific performance and ensure that you earn the correct commission.</p>\n<p>When an order is received, we correlate it to a specific promotion. We use the commission rules that the store has specified for that promotion to calculate your commission. Commissions are calculated on the pre-tax and shipping value of the order minus any customer discounts. If an order is refunded or changed, your commission will be re-calculated based on the new value.</p>\n<p>E.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your influencer commission is 10%.</li>\n<li>When customers use your influencer code, they get a 20% discount.</li>\n<li>You've referred Sarah from Instagram and she has created an order with the store worth $80 ($100 before discount). This amount does not include taxes / shipping.</li>\n<li>Your commission is calculated as 10% of $80. Which is $8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-track-my-commission\"><a href=\"#how-can-i-track-my-commission\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How can I track my commission?</h2>\n<p>You can view all orders that your influencer account has generated from the vwa.la > Orders page.
