This key will give you access to\nall content in Ghost programmatically, outside of Ghost core. Optionally, you\ncan also add an icon and description of your integration for your own reference.\n\nMore information about using Ghost's Content API can be found in the full \nContent API Documentation [https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/].\n\nSet up a webhook\nOptionally, custom integrations can also deliver outgoing webhooks based on\nevents which happen in Ghost to trigger actions elsewhere. For instance, an\nexternal notification or rebuild command. Available events to trigger webhooks\nare:\n\n * Site changed  (rebuild)\n * Subscriber added\n * Subscriber deleted\n\nMore info about Ghost webhooks can be found in the webhook documentation\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/webhooks/].\n\nZapier integrations\nFinally, custom integrations can be easily created using Zapier to build simple\nor complex integrations, depending on your needs.\n\nCheck out the Zapier integration page\n[https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/zapier/]  for more details.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"05 November, 2018","published_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"19 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-11-05T08:49:32.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-11-11T09:07:55.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-19T09:23:25.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Content","slug":"content","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Marketing","slug":"marketing","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Email","slug":"email","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Analytics","slug":"analytics","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Community","slug":"community","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Surveys & Forms","slug":"surveys-forms","visibility":"public"},{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"},{"name":"Social","slug":"social","visibility":"public"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tagSlug":"email","tagName":"Email","tagURL":"/integrations/email/","tagDescription":null,"tagImage":null,"tagMetaTitle":null,"tagMetaDescription":null,"section":"integrations"}}
