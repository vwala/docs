Once you have navigated to the correct email list in your Campaign Monitor\naccount and created a new signup form, grab the embed code to use on your Ghost\nsite: \n\nAs you can see in the preview, Campaign Monitor forms\n[https://help.campaignmonitor.com/html-subscribe-forms/]  are HTML and\nJavaScript, without any styling. It's possible to edit the HTML of the form to\nadd, remove or reorder the fields, and to add your own styling.

This is\nusually post.hbs. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see a line of code\nspecifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes a great place for\ndropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the code here, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form should then be visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed a subscribe button\nCampaign Monitor also has an option to embed a subscribe button, which opens a\npopup modal for readers to enter their information.\n\nIf you'd like to use this instead of the HTML form above, you can apply the same\nlogic and use the code provided to add it to an individual post or page, or\ninsert it in your theme's template files. \n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to automate RSS driven email campaigns to your subscribers,\nwhich sends the latest content on Ghost directly to your email list.\n\nCreate a new Automation in your Campaign Monitor account and use the \"Set up an\nRSS Campaign\" feature to get started. Enter the URL of the RSS feed which you'd\nlike to use to populate your newsletter content. Don't forget: You can add /rss/ \n to most URLs in Ghost to get a custom RSS feed.
