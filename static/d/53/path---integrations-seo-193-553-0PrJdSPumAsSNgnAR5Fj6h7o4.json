This template transforms each post on your site\ninto an AMP version which can be accessed by adding /amp  to the end of any URL.\n \n\nHere's an AMP page demo [https://demo.ghost.io/welcome/amp/]Enabling AMP in\nGhost\nThe AMP integration in Ghost is enabled by default, but if you prefer not to use\nthe feature then you can turn it off in the settings within Ghost Admin. When\nenabled, all posts on your publication will automatically have an AMP page, with\na canonical link to ensure the page is correctly identified by the search\nengines and no duplicate content issues are found. \n\nCustomise the template with your own styles\nAMP in Ghost can be styled to suit your brand and theme too! Since the Ghost\ntheme layer is entirely customisable, that means you can also customise the way\nyour AMP pages are rendered. \n\nSo if you would like to add some styling, branding or even monetise your AMP\npages with advertisements, then you can with a few lines of code in a single\nHandlebars template. \n\nRead more about customising your AMP pages in Ghost in this handy tutorial\n[https://docs.ghost.org/tutorials/custom-amp-themes/].\n\nValidate your template in the console\nThere is an effective way to validate your AMP pages as you go directly in the\nconsole by adding #development=1  to any AMP URL. \n\nThis is a useful way to ensure any customisations you make to your AMP template\nare valid and your AMP content is rendering correctly.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"16 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"19 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-20T19:08:11.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-08-16T19:08:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-19T10:39:56.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Marketing","slug":"marketing","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Content","slug":"content","visibility":"public"},{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Kym Ellis","slug":"kym"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3de6d06626b00bf606636","slug":"facebook","title":"Facebook","excerpt":"Ghost works with Facebook automatically in multiple ways to ensure that your\ncontent is fully optimised for the world's largest social network\n\nIntegrated structured data\nGhost contains integrated global settings and user settings to associate your\nsite, users, and individual posts with specific Facebook [https://facebook.com] \nusers and pages via automatic Open Graph [http://ogp.me/]  meta tags.

You can do this using the official Facebook Comments\n[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/]  plugin.\n\nCopy the Facebook comments code\nClick on the Get Code  button on the Facebook Comments\n[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/]  plugin settings page,\nand select the Facebook Page you would like to associate with your site\ncomments. We recommend disabling the Collect Analytics  feature.\n\nNext, copy the provided code in Step 2  and add it to Footer section of Ghost's \nCode Injection  settings area.\n\nPaste the final comment code into post.hbs\nNext, in your Ghost theme, locate the template file where you want to insert\ncomments on your site. Usually post.hbs  - right after the content. In Casper,\nGhost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved for\ninserting comments.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Here, you can add our\ncustomised code for Step 3, use this instead of the code provided by Facebook:\n\n<div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"{{url absolute=\"true\"}}\" data-numposts=\"10\"></div>\n\n\nThen save the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and restart Ghost.\nComments should now be loading on your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo more with Zapier\nAs always, you can power up your site even further using Zapier\n[https://zapier.com].
