The software is 100% free and open source, or\nyou can use their paid forum hosting options. If you're using Discourse to run a\ncommunity forum, then you might want to integrate this with Ghost to unlock\ncomments on your posts. \n\nSetting up a Discourse integration with Ghost involves a few steps and a basic\nknowledge of code â€“ but don't worry, this guide has got you covered!\n\nCreate an embeddable host on Discourse\nThe first step is to login to your Discourse account and create an embeddable\nhost, since this is where your comments will be hosted and embedded into your\nGhost posts. \n\nGo to Admin > Customise > Embedding  in your Discourse instance and create a new\nhost and enter some information:\n\n * Allowed Hosts  should be the hostname (your Ghost domain) where you want to\n   embed your comments - note the lack of http://  and path.\n * Class Name  is a class name that will be attached every time your iframe is\n   rendered. You can use this for styling purposes.\n * Path Whitelist  allows you to specify the paths that will accept your embed.\n   In this example, we want the embeds to appear on the /blog/  path.\n * Post to Category  - if you supply a category alongside the host you are\n   entering, posts imported from that host will automatically end up in that\n   category. \n\nOnce you save your new host, you should also ensure that there is a correct user\nentered in the settings menu. This is the Discourse user who will create topics,\nand is usually populated with the admin user:\n\nðŸ’¡ Tip: Use multiple hosts to post comment threads to different categories on\ndiscourse. For example, you could create a different host for different tag\npaths on your Ghost site, and have the comments appear in the relevant category\non Discourse. Edit the HTML provided \nOnce your new host is created, Discourse will provide the following snippet of\ncode: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: 'REPLACE_ME' };\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nIt will automatically enter your discourseUrl  and leave a REPLACE_ME  line\nwhere you'll need to enter the URL where your comments will be embedded. Since\nwe want to embed comments across all posts on the /blog/  route, we'll need to\nuse a helper to automatically generate the values, for example: {{url\nabsolute=\"true\"}}.\n\nPaste the embed code into post.hbs\nOnce your code is good to go, the next step is to paste it into the post.hbs \ntemplate in your theme files. This template is for all posts on your site.\nHere's what our final code snippet looks like in this example: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: '{{url absolute=\"true\"}}';\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nA good spot for this code is right after the content in the template file. In \nCasper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved\nfor inserting comments - paste your Discourse code here:\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Update your active theme\nOnce you've done this, all that's left is to update your active theme by\nuploading a fresh .zip  in Ghost Admin in the Design settings. The next time\nyour existing posts are visited, the Discourse thread will be created, and\nyou'll be able to see the comments function at the bottom of your posts. Here's\nan example of what it looks like on Coding Horror's site: \n\nFinally, when you create a new post on your site, it automatically has the\ncomments feature once you hit publish ðŸŽ‰\n\nStyling your Embedded content (Optional)\nOn the latest build of Discourse it is possible to add a stylesheet for your\nembedded comments.

Anything which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript will always work - so\nif you have an embed code then chances are all you need to do is copy and paste\nit for everything to work.\n\nAPI+webhook integrations\nGhost also supports custom API integrations which can be authenticated with\nindividual keys, and deliver outgoing webhooks based on particular events.\n\nAdd a new custom integration\nFrom the integrations screen in Ghost Admin, click on the Add custom integration \n button\n\nCopy API key\nAll custom integrations automatically come with a Content API  key which can be\ncopied as soon as the integration is created. This key will give you access to\nall content in Ghost programmatically, outside of Ghost core. Optionally, you\ncan also add an icon and description of your integration for your own reference.\n\nMore information about using Ghost's Content API can be found in the full \nContent API Documentation [https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/].\n\nSet up a webhook\nOptionally, custom integrations can also deliver outgoing webhooks based on\nevents which happen in Ghost to trigger actions elsewhere. For instance, an\nexternal notification or rebuild command. Available events to trigger webhooks\nare:\n\n * Site changed  (rebuild)\n * Subscriber added\n * Subscriber deleted\n\nMore info about Ghost webhooks can be found in the webhook documentation\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/webhooks/].\n\nZapier integrations\nFinally, custom integrations can be easily created using Zapier to build simple\nor complex integrations, depending on your needs.\n\nCheck out the Zapier integration page\n[https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/zapier/]  for more details.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"05 November, 2018","published_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"19 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-11-05T08:49:32.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-11-11T09:07:55.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-19T09:23:25.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Content","slug":"content","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Marketing","slug":"marketing","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Email","slug":"email","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Analytics","slug":"analytics","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Community","slug":"community","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Surveys & Forms","slug":"surveys-forms","visibility":"public"},{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"},{"name":"Social","slug":"social","visibility":"public"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tagSlug":"community","tagName":"Community","tagURL":"/integrations/community/","tagDescription":null,"tagImage":null,"tagMetaTitle":null,"tagMetaDescription":null,"section":"integrations"}}
