Head over to Zapier.com [https://zapier.com]  to\nmanually create the exact automation you need.

This is incredibly useful for automating tasks which you do\nregularly and don't want to have to remember - like automatically sharing new\nblog posts to social networks. It also comes in very handy for keeping multiple\ntools in sync, for example making sure that every time someone subscribes or\nunsubscribes to a newsletter in Ghost or Mailchimp, making sure that change is\nreflected in the subscriber databases for both services.\n\nIt's worth noting that some Zaps are instant, while others run in timed\nintervals. You may sometimes notice a 15 minute gap between a Trigger and an\nAction - this is perfectly normal.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"13 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"01 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-13T20:44:08.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-08-01T01:00:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-11T09:20:47.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3efa506626b00bf606693","slug":"disqus","title":"Disqus","excerpt":"If you're in need of a quick way to get fully-functional commenting on a Ghost\nsite, Disqus [https://disqus.com]  may be what you're looking for\n\nDisqus allows you to embed comment threads within Ghost posts and pages,\nincluding additional functionality like upvoting and adding Emoji reactions.

This also makes a great place for\ndropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the code here, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost.

In this example, we'll look at the partial\nfile used for all post archives in Ghost's default theme, Casper\n[https://github.com/tryghost/casper].\n\nOn line 4  of /partials/post-card.hbs  we can see the code used to output the\npost's feature image in post lists.

For example: \nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url\nfeature_image absolute=\"true\"}}\n\nCloudinary will automatically resize the image to fit within a 600x400px box,\nmaintaining the original aspect ratio, and return the image as normal. You can\ncustomise how you want the image to be modified based on your own needs, using\nCloudinary's image transformation features\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations].\n\nThe final code in your theme should look like:\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url feature_image absolute=\"true\"}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nDon't forget to replace YOURUSERNAME  with your Cloudinary username.

Here are some widely tested, open\nsource storage adapters for Amazon S3 that have comprehensive setup guides: \n\n * ghost-s3-compat [https://github.com/spanishdict/ghost-s3-compat]\n * ghost-storage-adapter-s3\n   [https://github.com/colinmeinke/ghost-storage-adapter-s3]  \n\nWhen using a storage adapter in Ghost, your images are uploaded directly to\nAmazon S3 and integrated into its media library, allowing you to use their\nservice directly to manage your image assets.\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nIt's also possible to connect Amazon S3 to more of your favourite tools with\nZapier to make it more useful and powerful to your workflow.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"04 December, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-20T18:10:39.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-20T18:10:50.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-12-04T06:46:13.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Kym Ellis","slug":"kym"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c2cf9d3fd06ca00c03276a6","slug":"backtracks","title":"Backtracks","excerpt":"Podcast content from Backtracks works with Ghost automatically via our OEmbed\nintegration.

The software is 100% free and open source, or\nyou can use their paid forum hosting options. If you're using Discourse to run a\ncommunity forum, then you might want to integrate this with Ghost to unlock\ncomments on your posts. \n\nSetting up a Discourse integration with Ghost involves a few steps and a basic\nknowledge of code – but don't worry, this guide has got you covered!\n\nCreate an embeddable host on Discourse\nThe first step is to login to your Discourse account and create an embeddable\nhost, since this is where your comments will be hosted and embedded into your\nGhost posts. \n\nGo to Admin > Customise > Embedding  in your Discourse instance and create a new\nhost and enter some information:\n\n * Allowed Hosts  should be the hostname (your Ghost domain) where you want to\n   embed your comments - note the lack of http://  and path.\n * Class Name  is a class name that will be attached every time your iframe is\n   rendered. You can use this for styling purposes.\n * Path Whitelist  allows you to specify the paths that will accept your embed.\n   In this example, we want the embeds to appear on the /blog/  path.\n * Post to Category  - if you supply a category alongside the host you are\n   entering, posts imported from that host will automatically end up in that\n   category. \n\nOnce you save your new host, you should also ensure that there is a correct user\nentered in the settings menu. This is the Discourse user who will create topics,\nand is usually populated with the admin user:\n\n💡 Tip: Use multiple hosts to post comment threads to different categories on\ndiscourse. For example, you could create a different host for different tag\npaths on your Ghost site, and have the comments appear in the relevant category\non Discourse. Edit the HTML provided \nOnce your new host is created, Discourse will provide the following snippet of\ncode: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: 'REPLACE_ME' };\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nIt will automatically enter your discourseUrl  and leave a REPLACE_ME  line\nwhere you'll need to enter the URL where your comments will be embedded. Since\nwe want to embed comments across all posts on the /blog/  route, we'll need to\nuse a helper to automatically generate the values, for example: {{url\nabsolute=\"true\"}}.\n\nPaste the embed code into post.hbs\nOnce your code is good to go, the next step is to paste it into the post.hbs \ntemplate in your theme files. This template is for all posts on your site.\nHere's what our final code snippet looks like in this example: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: '{{url absolute=\"true\"}}';\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nA good spot for this code is right after the content in the template file. In \nCasper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved\nfor inserting comments - paste your Discourse code here:\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Update your active theme\nOnce you've done this, all that's left is to update your active theme by\nuploading a fresh .zip  in Ghost Admin in the Design settings. The next time\nyour existing posts are visited, the Discourse thread will be created, and\nyou'll be able to see the comments function at the bottom of your posts. Here's\nan example of what it looks like on Coding Horror's site: \n\nFinally, when you create a new post on your site, it automatically has the\ncomments feature once you hit publish 🎉\n\nStyling your Embedded content (Optional)\nOn the latest build of Discourse it is possible to add a stylesheet for your\nembedded comments. Visit Admin > Customise > CSS/HTML > Embedded CSS  and you\ncan add a custom styling for your comments threads.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"07 December, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-20T19:07:14.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-20T19:07:34.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-12-07T11:55:54.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Community","slug":"community","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Kym Ellis","slug":"kym"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3f0c906626b00bf6066a4","slug":"slideshare","title":"SlideShare","excerpt":"Slideshare presentations can be displayed in Ghost content automatically using\nsensible embeds - paste a code snippet and embed your slide decks\n\nThere are lots of ways to share visual content inside the Ghost editor,\nincluding adding single images and full image galleries.

They can\nall be enabled or embedded efficiently using code injection or HTML cards in the\neditor. \n\nFirst you'll need to create a new signup form  in your Drip account:\n\nEach form you create has a unique reference name and can be configured\nindividually, with the option to use the embed code to inject raw un-styled\nforms in HTML, or the widget popup forms across your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form on a single post\nTo use HTML embedded forms, locate the embed code from within the form editor in\nyour Drip account: \n\nTo add the signup form to a particular post or page on your site, add a new HTML\nblock within the Ghost editor and paste the embed code there. \n\nOnce you hit publish, an un-styled (but functional) form will appear on your\npost or page. To add your own styling to this form, edit the CSS in your theme\nfiles and update your theme in Ghost Admin. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form across multiple pages\nOn the other hand, you can also insert the form HTML into the appropriate\ntemplate files within your theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs  right after the content. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see\na line of code specifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes a\ngreat place for dropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the code\nhere, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form should then be visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse the widget form on multiple pages of your site\nIf you'd like to use the Drip widget forms on various parts of your site, go to\nyour account settings in Drip and copy and paste the Javascript snippet in the\nsite setup menu: \n\nThis snippet can be pasted into the site-wide code injection in Ghost Admin if\nyou'd like to implement the widget across your site. Additionally, Drip allows\nyou to specify which URLs the widget will appear on in the form editor for more\nfine-grained control.\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to use the Drip RSS-to-Email\n[https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003731671-RSS-to-Email]  feature to\ngenerate automated newsletters of your latest content on Ghost, directly to your\nsubscribers!\n\nOnce you've activated the feature, wire up the RSS feed which you'd like to use\nto populate your newsletter content.

We recommend disabling the Collect Analytics  feature.\n\nNext, copy the provided code in Step 2  and add it to Footer section of Ghost's \nCode Injection  settings area.\n\nPaste the final comment code into post.hbs\nNext, in your Ghost theme, locate the template file where you want to insert\ncomments on your site. Usually post.hbs  - right after the content. In Casper,\nGhost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved for\ninserting comments.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Here, you can add our\ncustomised code for Step 3, use this instead of the code provided by Facebook:\n\n<div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"{{url absolute=\"true\"}}\" data-numposts=\"10\"></div>\n\n\nThen save the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and restart Ghost.\nComments should now be loading on your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo more with Zapier\nAs always, you can power up your site even further using Zapier\n[https://zapier.com].
