We now track influencer referrals and payable commission. Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.vwa.la/merchant/paying-commission/.#payment-rules--customization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">payable commission</a> - how it is calculated and how payable commission rules can be customised. </li>\n<li>By default, the emails that we send on your behalf route replies to our support mailbox. You can now set a <code class=\"language-text\">reply-to</code> email address via <code class=\"language-text\">my account &gt; store settings &gt; email</code>. When set, all replies to the emails that we send on your behalf will be sent to your support email address.</li>\n<li>Exports now respect your table filters/selections, allowing for fine-grained data exports. To export all, make sure that your table has no selections or active filters. </li>\n<li>We’ve introduced batch processing to improve the performance and scalability of the platform. For example, updating your promotion policy will trigger all affected codes/links to synchronise in the background. Progress of background tasks can be viewed via your in-app notifications window (right side panel). The same solution applies to our data export, 3rd party app sync (mailchimp/klaviyo) and lead event processing subsystems. </li>\n<li>We've added the ability to pay commission by influencer group. Use the <code class=\"language-text\">customise</code> section of the <code class=\"language-text\">pay commission</code> form to choose the group that you wish to pay.</li>\n<li>We now proactively validate each influencer's PayPal account on signup and notify them of any account setup issues via their dashboard. Note: If your preferred commission payment method is not <code class=\"language-text\">PayPal</code> (i.e. store credit) then we will not display <code class=\"language-text\">PayPal</code> setup issues to your influencers.</li>\n<li>We've fixed an issue with Mailchimp rate limiting changes breaking synchronisation for large merchants</li>\n<li>We've fixed some issues with tooltip colours clashing</li>\n<li>We've fixed some scenarios where UTM tags were not being tracked through complex link flows</li>\n<li>We've improved our support for older mobile devices</li>\n<li>We've made many improvements to our in-app chat solution</li>\n<li>We significantly improved the performance and scalability of our in-store widget configuration hosting. This has multiple benefits, such as improved app startup times globally as well as reduced load on our real-time messaging system. </li>\n<li>We've upgraded our server technology as part of our continued effort to maintain software currency and security. </li>\n<li>We've upgraded our UX framework. This gave us the opportunity to adopt a better date/time picker. This should make date filtering simpler and more intuitive. The new framework also means that the application download size is improved further. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks all for the feedback.
