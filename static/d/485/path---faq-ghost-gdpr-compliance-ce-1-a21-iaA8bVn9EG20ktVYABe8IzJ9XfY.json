For example, we will be a processor of EU personal data and\ninformation that gets uploaded into a Ghost site. \n\nWe act as a data controller for the EU customer information we collect to\nprovide our products and services and to provide timely customer support. This\ncustomer information includes things such as customer name and contact\ninformation.\n\nWhat personal data do we collect and store from our customers?\nWe store data that customers have given us voluntarily. For example, in our role\nas data controller, we may collect and store contact information such as name\nand email address when customers sign up for our products and services or seek\nsupport. We also may collect other identifying information from our customers,\nsuch as IP address.\n\nWe separately act as a data processor when customers use our products and\nservices to process EU personal data, such as uploading personal data to a Ghost\nsite. Customers decide what personal data, if any, is uploaded to our products\nand services.\n\nWhat is the Ghost Data Processing Agreement (\"DPA\")?\nCustomers that handle EU personal data are required to comply with the privacy\nand security requirements under the GDPR. As part of this, they must ensure that\nthe vendors they use to process the EU personal data also have privacy and\nsecurity protections in place. Our DPA outlines the privacy and security\nprotections we have in place. We are committed to GDPR compliance and to helping\nour customers comply with the GDPR when they use our services. We have therefore\nmade our DPA available to all our customers and it can be found here: Data\nProcessing Agreement [https://ghost.org/dpa/].\n\nAre customers required to sign the Ghost DPA?\nIn order to use our products and services, you need to accept our DPA, which we\nhave provided a link to on our website: Data Processing Agreement\n[https://ghost.org/dpa/]. By agreeing to our terms of service, you are\nautomatically accepting our DPA and do not need to sign a separate document.\n\nCan a customer share the Ghost DPA with its customers?\nYes. The DPA is a publicly available document and customers who wish to share it\nwith their customers to confirm our security measures and other terms may feel\nfree to do so.\n\nDo customers need to notify anyone upon accepting our DPA?\nNo. You are not required to notify us or any third party upon accepting our DPA\nthough, as mentioned above, you are free to do so.\n\nAre there unique DPA needs for individual countries?\nThe GDPR applies to all of the EU and we offer a DPA that is compliant in all EU\ncountries.\n\nDo we transfer data internationally?\nGhost stores all data in the EU. In certain circumstances, we will process\npersonal data that originates from the EU in outside of the EU when conducting\nsupport and maintenance of our services. We provide a level of protection of\nprivacy that complies with the EU rules.\n\nHow do we handle delete instructions from customers?\nCustomers have the ability to remove or delete information they have uploaded to\nour products.
