This ensures subscribers in Ghost are always pushed to\nDrip or vice versa and keeps everything in sync, saving you the time of doing\nmanual updates.\n\nOnce this integration has been setup it'll run in the background and make sure\nthat your subscriber lists are always up to date.\n\nEmbed Drip email subscription forms\nIf you prefer to use Drip's own subscriber forms directly, it's possible to use\nany of the form builders, widgets or other embed options within Ghost. They can\nall be enabled or embedded efficiently using code injection or HTML cards in the\neditor. \n\nFirst you'll need to create a new signup form  in your Drip account:\n\nEach form you create has a unique reference name and can be configured\nindividually, with the option to use the embed code to inject raw un-styled\nforms in HTML, or the widget popup forms across your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form on a single post\nTo use HTML embedded forms, locate the embed code from within the form editor in\nyour Drip account: \n\nTo add the signup form to a particular post or page on your site, add a new HTML\nblock within the Ghost editor and paste the embed code there. \n\nOnce you hit publish, an un-styled (but functional) form will appear on your\npost or page. To add your own styling to this form, edit the CSS in your theme\nfiles and update your theme in Ghost Admin. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form across multiple pages\nOn the other hand, you can also insert the form HTML into the appropriate\ntemplate files within your theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs  right after the content. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see\na line of code specifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes a\ngreat place for dropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the code\nhere, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form should then be visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse the widget form on multiple pages of your site\nIf you'd like to use the Drip widget forms on various parts of your site, go to\nyour account settings in Drip and copy and paste the Javascript snippet in the\nsite setup menu: \n\nThis snippet can be pasted into the site-wide code injection in Ghost Admin if\nyou'd like to implement the widget across your site. Additionally, Drip allows\nyou to specify which URLs the widget will appear on in the form editor for more\nfine-grained control.\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to use the Drip RSS-to-Email\n[https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003731671-RSS-to-Email]  feature to\ngenerate automated newsletters of your latest content on Ghost, directly to your\nsubscribers!\n\nOnce you've activated the feature, wire up the RSS feed which you'd like to use\nto populate your newsletter content. Don't forget: You can add /rss/  to most\nURLs in Ghost to get a custom RSS feed. Here are some demo examples:\n\n * Main post index  - https://demo.ghost.io/rss/\n * Author archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/author/lewis/rss/\n * Tag archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/tag/fiction/rss/\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nConnect Drip to many more of your favourite tools and align all of your\nprocesses using Zapier.
