We recommend disabling the Collect Analytics  feature.\n\nNext, copy the provided code in Step 2  and add it to Footer section of Ghost's \nCode Injection  settings area.\n\nPaste the final comment code into post.hbs\nNext, in your Ghost theme, locate the template file where you want to insert\ncomments on your site. Usually post.hbs  - right after the content. In Casper,\nGhost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved for\ninserting comments.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Here, you can add our\ncustomised code for Step 3, use this instead of the code provided by Facebook:\n\n<div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"{{url absolute=\"true\"}}\" data-numposts=\"10\"></div>\n\n\nThen save the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and restart Ghost.\nComments should now be loading on your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo more with Zapier\nAs always, you can power up your site even further using Zapier\n[https://zapier.com].
