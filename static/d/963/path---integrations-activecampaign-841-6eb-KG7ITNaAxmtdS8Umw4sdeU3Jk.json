You\ncan use any  of form, bar, box or modal code provided by ActiveCampaign within\nGhost.\n\nFirst you'll need to create a new signup form  for your ActiveCampaign list.\nselect the options you'd like to use, and copy the code provided. You can use\neither the Simple Embed  or the Full Embed  - they both do the same thing, but\nthe Full Embed allows you to customise the code if you want to.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd the form to a single post\nIf you just want to add the signup form to one particular post or page on your\nsite - you can add a new HTML block within the Ghost editor and paste the embed\ncode there. Hit publish. And you're all set.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd the form to multiple pages of your site\nOn the other hand, if you'd like to add a newsletter signup form to multiple\npages of your site - then you'll need to add the embed code to your Ghost theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs  - right after the content. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll\nsee a line of code specifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes\na great place for dropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the\ncode here, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form should then be visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to use the ActiveCampaign RSS-to-Email\n[https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/206641310-RSS-and-email-marketing] \n feature to generate automated newsletters of your latest content on Ghost,\ndirectly to your subscribers! To do this, create a new RSS Triggered  campaign:\n\nOnce you've selected the list options you'd Â like to use and you reach the\ndesign stage, insert an RSS Feed  block into your newsletter template:\n\nThen select the RSS feed you'd like to use in your newsletter. Don't forget: You\ncan add /rss/  to most URLs in Ghost to get a custom RSS feed. Here are some\ndemo examples:\n\n * Main post index  - https://demo.ghost.io/rss/\n * Author archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/author/lewis/rss/\n * Tag archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/tag/fiction/rss/\n\nOnce everything is configured you'll see your RSS feed appearing within your\nnewsletter template. From here you can finish up your design, and set the\nschedule for how often you'd like your campaign to check the RSS feed for new\nitems and send to your subscribers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nYou can connect ActiveCampaign to more of your favourite tools using Zapier,\nwith lots of commonly used Zaps already pre-built.
