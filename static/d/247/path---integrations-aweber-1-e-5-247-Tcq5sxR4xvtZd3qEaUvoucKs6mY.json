Here's more details about these integrations:\n\nSync Ghost subscribers with AWeber\nKeeping your readers emails up to date is important for effective email\ncampaigns. If you're using the built-in subscribers feature\n[https://docs.ghost.org/faq/enable-subscribers-feature/]  in Ghost, it's\npossible to sync these email addresses with your AWeber account using Zapier.\nThis ensures subscribers in Ghost are always pushed to AWeber or vice versa,\nsaving you the time of doing manual updates.\n\nOnce this integration has been setup it'll run in the background and make sure\nthat your subscriber lists are always up to date.\n\nEmbed AWeber sign up forms\nIf you want to turn visitors into subscribers using sign up forms from AWeber,\nthis is entirely possible within Ghost. Sign up forms can be embedded\nefficiently using HTML cards in the editor, or directly in your site's theme\nfiles. \n\nOnce you have created and customised a new sign up form\n[https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/204027476-How-do-I-create-a-sign-up-form-] \n in your Aweber account, locate and copy the raw HTML embed code:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd the form to a single post\nIf you just want to add the sign up form to one particular post or page on your\nsite - you can add a new HTML block within the Ghost editor and paste the embed\ncode there. Once you publish your post or page your form should be in place and\nready to collect new subscribers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd the form to multiple pages of your site\nIf you'd like to add a sign up form to multiple pages of your site, the most\neffective way to do this is to add the embed code to the relevant file in your\nGhost theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs. In Ghost's default theme Casper, you'll see a line of code\nspecifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes a great place for\ndropping in a newsletter signup form:\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing, save the file\nand upload a fresh copy of your theme and if you're self-hosting don't forget to\nrestart Ghost. The form is now visible on every post!\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIf you'd like to send automated campaigns with the latest content from Ghost\ndirectly to your subscribers, you can use an RSS feed to achieve this. Adding \n/rss/  to most URLs in Ghost results in a custom RSS feed. Here are some demo\nexamples:\n\n * Main post index  - https://demo.ghost.io/rss/\n * Author archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/author/lewis/rss/\n * Tag archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/tag/fiction/rss/\n\nAWeber has an RSS to Email feature which allows you to use your RSS URL to\ngenerate an automated campaign.\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nConnect AWeber with many more of your favourite tools and align all of your\nprocesses using Zapier.
