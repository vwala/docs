Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of\ncontent that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can\nsupport their own cover images and meta data.\n\nPrimary Tag\nTags can drag and dropped into a specific order from the post settings menu. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default.\n\nNews, Technology, StartupPrivate Tags\nIn Ghost, hashtags are private tags and can be used for special styling. \n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. \n\nNews, #videoHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tag of News\n- but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. \n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/].\n\nPosts & pages\nThere are two types of content in Ghost than can be organised with tags: posts\n[https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/posts/]  and pages\n[https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/pages/]. Posts are the primary content type and\nposts will belong to an index page or collection of posts. Pages are generally\nused for static one-off content, and are excluded from all feeds.
