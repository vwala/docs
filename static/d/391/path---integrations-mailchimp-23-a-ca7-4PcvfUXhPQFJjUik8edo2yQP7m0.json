Hit publish. And you're all set.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd the form to multiple pages of your site\nOn the other hand, if you'd like to add a newsletter signup form to multiple\npages of your site - then you'll need to add the embed code to your Ghost theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs  - right after the content. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll\nsee a line of code specifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes\na great place for dropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the\ncode here, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form is now visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to use the Mailchimp RSS-to-Email\n[https://mailchimp.com/features/rss-to-email/]  feature to generate automated\nnewsletters of your latest content on Ghost, directly to your subscribers!\n\nOnce you've created a new campaign, enter the RSS feed which you'd like to use\nto populate your newsletter content. Don't forget: You can add /rss/  to most\nURLs in Ghost to get a custom RSS feed. Here are some demo examples:\n\n * Main post index  - https://demo.ghost.io/rss/\n * Author archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/author/lewis/rss/\n * Tag archive  - https://demo.ghost.io/tag/fiction/rss/\n\nMailchimp will then automatically read your RSS feed at the time interval you\nspecify and email your subscribers all of your latest posts automatically!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nIt's possible to connect Mailchimp to many more of your favourite tools and\nalign all of your processes using Zapier with lots of commonly used Zaps already\npre-built, or if you can't find what you're looking for you can build your own:","html":"<p>Integrate Ghost with Mailchimp to keep subscribers in sync and deliver email campaigns efficiently</p><p>The most popular ways to integrate Mailchimp with Ghost are to sync your email subscribers, embedding custom email subscription or signup forms and creating an RSS driven newsletter.</p><p>Let's run through a few of the different ways you can use Ghost and Mailchimp together:</p><h2 id=\"sync-ghost-subscribers-to-mailchimp\"><strong>Sync Ghost subscribers to Mailchimp</strong></h2><p>If you're collecting your visitors email addresses using the built-in <a href=\"https://docs.ghost.org/faq/enable-subscribers-feature/\">subscribers feature</a> in Ghost, it's possible to link this with your Mailchimp account using Zapier to ensure subscribers in Ghost are always pushed into Mailchimp, or vice versa.</p><p>This saves tons of time manually updating email lists, and ensures everything is fully in sync and secure.</p><div id=\"zapp\" class=\"zapier\">\n\t<script src=\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=mailchimp,ghost&limit=15&html_id=zapp\"></script>\n</div><p>Once this integration has been setup it'll run in the background and make sure that your subscriber lists are always up to date.</p><hr><h2 id=\"embed-an-email-subscription-form\">Embed an email subscription form</h2><p>If you prefer to use Mailchimp's own subscriber forms directly, that works too!
