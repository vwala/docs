Cloudinary is a paid service, however it does\ncome with a free tier which is more than sufficient for most people.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to integrate it with Ghost.\n\nAutomatic optimisation with fetch\nGhost has automatic responsive image sizes\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/responsive-images/]  built in by\ndefault, allowing you to output images at different sizes depending on the needs\nof your theme. If you prefer to use an externally hosted media solution, though,\nCloudinary can do the same thing via API.\n\nCloudinary's Fetch remote images\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images]  service is a simple\nway to deliver externally optimised images. For example, if you have 2000px\ncover images on all your posts, but on your homepage you want to display 200px\nthumbnails which are properly resized and optimised, then Cloudinary can take\ncare of that part for you automatically just by prefixing your feature images\nwith a special URL.\n\nEdit your theme files\nFirst, you'll need to sign up for a Cloudinary account and then edit your Ghost\ntheme files with updated image URLs. In this example, we'll look at the partial\nfile used for all post archives in Ghost's default theme, Casper\n[https://github.com/tryghost/casper].\n\nOn line 4  of /partials/post-card.hbs  we can see the code used to output the\npost's feature image in post lists. This piece of code is used on the home page,\ntag archives, and author archives - so any changes made here will update\neverywhere.\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url({{feature_image}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nTo have Cloudinary resize this image automatically to a more appropriate size,\nall you have to do is replace the {{feature_image}}  helper with your Cloudinary\nURL + an absolute image path. For example: \nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url\nfeature_image absolute=\"true\"}}\n\nCloudinary will automatically resize the image to fit within a 600x400px box,\nmaintaining the original aspect ratio, and return the image as normal. You can\ncustomise how you want the image to be modified based on your own needs, using\nCloudinary's image transformation features\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations].\n\nThe final code in your theme should look like:\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url feature_image absolute=\"true\"}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nDon't forget to replace YOURUSERNAME  with your Cloudinary username. Once you've\nsaved and uploaded your theme, your images will be automatically delivered by\nCloudinary's CDN and resized on the fly.\n\nFull Cloudinary storage adapter\nBy default, Ghost stores any images uploaded to Ghost Admin locally to its\nfilesystem, and delivers them via the same Ghost front-end service which\ndelivers Ghost themes. However, it's also possible to replace this layer\nentirely using a custom storage adapter, to upload and serve images directly\nto/from external services.\n\nUsing a storage adapter, images are uploaded directly to Cloudinary and\nintegrated into its media library, unlocking a larger quantity of advanced image\nmanipulation features which can be useful for people with image-heavy sites who\nneed a lot of processing â€“ or people who want a detailed media management user\ninterface to manage their library of assets.\n\nGhost-Storage-Cloudinary [https://github.com/eexit/ghost-storage-cloudinary]  is\na heavily tested open source storage adapter Â which contains detailed\ninstructions about how to configure it.\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nIt's also possible to connect Cloudinary to more of your favourite tools with\nZapier to make it more useful and powerful to your workflow.","html":"<p>Deliver automatically optimised images using Cloudinary and Ghost in tandem, either on-the-fly or with full media library</p><p><a href=\"https://cloudinary.com\">Cloudinary</a> is a full-stack media optimisation platform which automates processing and optimisation of images and video to help deliver them efficiently to your readers.
