We've released some major and minor improvements to our platform that we hope you'll love.</p>\n<p>Whats new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We have released a major upgrade to our in-store integration. Your referrer signup, login and dashboard pages are now fully embedded into you store. This means from your customers/referrers perspective, they'll never have to leave your store to discover and use your referral marketing program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've released a new user on-boarding experience, for both merchants and referrers. It will make learning how to use <a href=\"https://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> significantly easier for new users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've further reduced the download size of the application. The app should now load 20% faster.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've fixed various issues with our Safari 10.x support. These are caused by older versions of Safari not supported modern HTML standards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've fixed an issue where unusually long HTTP referrer headers could cause lead events to drop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've improved our email template by removing our address from the footer and by making our email verification email branded. This will make our email template less confusing to referrers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks all for the feedback. We can't wait to release our upcoming feature lists, especially our in-app messaging solution!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/releases/2018-07-20/"},"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Hi team, We've had a very productive week here.
