If this doesn't suit your needs, it is\nentirely possible to create a static custom home page instead ðŸŽ‰\n\nThere really is no limit to what you can put on a static home page. Whether you\nneed to explain what your publication is all about, or provide a hub with quick\nlinks to different sections of your site. It's totally up to you! \n\nOverview\nSetting up a custom home page involves configuring the routes in your \nroutes.yaml  file, as well as creating a custom template in your theme. The end\nresult is a unique static page on your /  root domain. \n\nThis tutorial walks you through the entire setup process for setting up custom\nstatic pages using the Ghost theme layer and dynamic routing. \n\nSingle route template configuration\nA single route can be defined in the flexible dynamic routing layer. In the Labs\npage in Ghost admin, download your routes.yaml  file and open it in any code\neditor. \n\nThis file is split into three sections, and for this tutorial you'll be using\nthe \"routes\" section - read more about dynamic routing\n[https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/routing/].\n\nSingle routes are mapped to a template, for example:\n\nroutes:\n  /: home\n\n\nIf you have more than one custom static page, then you can replicate the process\nand list all single routes and respective templates on a new line: \n\nroutes:\n  /: home\n  /about/: about\n  /subscribe/: subscribe\n\n\nThis configuration allows you to create unique content and templates for each\nsingle route using the Ghost theme layer. \n\nCreate a template for each static URL\nTo render unique content on your static pages, create different templates for\neach page. In the routes  example above, the outcome would be to render the\nspecified template: \n\n * https://yoursite.com/ ðŸ‘‰ home.hbs  \n * https://yoursite.com/about/ ðŸ‘‰ about.hbs  \n * https://yoursite.com/subscribe/ ðŸ‘‰ subscribe.hbs  \n\nIf the template is not found then the fallback template is used instead, for\nexample index.hbs  or default.hbs.\n\nCreate new templates for your new home page or static pages. If you need further\nhelp creating a custom template, visit the theme documentation\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/]  to find out more! \n\nThis method of creating content on a static URL allows you to completely render\nyour content and design from the handlebars template and CSS files, without\nusing posts or the Ghost editor. Check out the custom template tutorial\n[https://docs.ghost.org/tutorials/custom-page-templates]  to find out how to\nfetch dynamic content from Ghost and render it on a static URL. \n\nUsing the data attribute\nWhen rendering a route that is not /  there is no implicit context\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/context/]  but you can use the \ndata  attribute [https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/routing/#data]  on the route to\nfetch resources using Ghostâ€™s API, for example: \n\nroutes:\n  /:\n    data: page.home\n    template: home\n  /about/careers/:\n    data: page.careers\n    template: careers\n  /about/team/:\n    data: page.team\n    template: team\n\n\nIt's also possible to use the {{get}} [https://themes.ghost.org/docs/get]  \nhelper [https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/helpers/get/]  in the\nroute's template to fetch any dynamic content that you want to render.\n\nNavigation considerations\nSince each static page that you create is unique, it's important to ensure you\nbuild in some site navigation to your new templates for each static page. The\nnavigation for Ghost content and collections can be edited in the Design menu in\nGhost admin. \n\nImplement your routes and templates\nOnce you have finished editing the routes.yaml  file, created your new\nhandlebars templates and made any necessary adjustments to your CSS files, it's\ntime to get your new custom home page or static pages live on your site. \n\n 1. Upload your edited routes.yaml  file in Ghost admin\n 2. Upload your new theme .zip  containing new templates and CSS in Ghost admin\n 3. Visit your site and ensure your new static pages render correctly\n\nSummary\nNice work! You've figured out how to create a custom static home page for your\nGhost publication, where you can render any content and design required from\nyour theme. This same process can be repeated to create multiple static pages to\nsuit your needs.","html":"<p>When you first spin up an instance of Ghost, your home page renders the publication's content on the root domain.
