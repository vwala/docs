Head over to Zapier.com [https://zapier.com]  to\nmanually create the exact automation you need.

This is incredibly useful for automating tasks which you do\nregularly and don't want to have to remember - like automatically sharing new\nblog posts to social networks. It also comes in very handy for keeping multiple\ntools in sync, for example making sure that every time someone subscribes or\nunsubscribes to a newsletter in Ghost or Mailchimp, making sure that change is\nreflected in the subscriber databases for both services.\n\nIt's worth noting that some Zaps are instant, while others run in timed\nintervals. You may sometimes notice a 15 minute gap between a Trigger and an\nAction - this is perfectly normal.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"13 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"01 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-13T20:44:08.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-08-01T01:00:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-11T09:20:47.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3ddd806626b00bf606627","slug":"google","title":"Google Analytics","excerpt":"Want deep analytics for your Ghost publication?

The software is 100% free and open source, or\nyou can use their paid forum hosting options. If you're using Discourse to run a\ncommunity forum, then you might want to integrate this with Ghost to unlock\ncomments on your posts. \n\nSetting up a Discourse integration with Ghost involves a few steps and a basic\nknowledge of code – but don't worry, this guide has got you covered!\n\nCreate an embeddable host on Discourse\nThe first step is to login to your Discourse account and create an embeddable\nhost, since this is where your comments will be hosted and embedded into your\nGhost posts. \n\nGo to Admin > Customise > Embedding  in your Discourse instance and create a new\nhost and enter some information:\n\n * Allowed Hosts  should be the hostname (your Ghost domain) where you want to\n   embed your comments - note the lack of http://  and path.\n * Class Name  is a class name that will be attached every time your iframe is\n   rendered. You can use this for styling purposes.\n * Path Whitelist  allows you to specify the paths that will accept your embed.\n   In this example, we want the embeds to appear on the /blog/  path.\n * Post to Category  - if you supply a category alongside the host you are\n   entering, posts imported from that host will automatically end up in that\n   category. \n\nOnce you save your new host, you should also ensure that there is a correct user\nentered in the settings menu. This is the Discourse user who will create topics,\nand is usually populated with the admin user:\n\n💡 Tip: Use multiple hosts to post comment threads to different categories on\ndiscourse. For example, you could create a different host for different tag\npaths on your Ghost site, and have the comments appear in the relevant category\non Discourse. Edit the HTML provided \nOnce your new host is created, Discourse will provide the following snippet of\ncode: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: 'REPLACE_ME' };\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nIt will automatically enter your discourseUrl  and leave a REPLACE_ME  line\nwhere you'll need to enter the URL where your comments will be embedded. Since\nwe want to embed comments across all posts on the /blog/  route, we'll need to\nuse a helper to automatically generate the values, for example: {{url\nabsolute=\"true\"}}.\n\nPaste the embed code into post.hbs\nOnce your code is good to go, the next step is to paste it into the post.hbs \ntemplate in your theme files. This template is for all posts on your site.\nHere's what our final code snippet looks like in this example: \n\n<div id='discourse-comments'></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://forum.ghost.org/',\n                     discourseEmbedUrl: '{{url absolute=\"true\"}}';\n\n  (function() {\n    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;\n    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);\n  })();\n</script>\n\n\nA good spot for this code is right after the content in the template file. In \nCasper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see a line of code specifically reserved\nfor inserting comments - paste your Discourse code here:\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69Update your active theme\nOnce you've done this, all that's left is to update your active theme by\nuploading a fresh .zip  in Ghost Admin in the Design settings. The next time\nyour existing posts are visited, the Discourse thread will be created, and\nyou'll be able to see the comments function at the bottom of your posts. Here's\nan example of what it looks like on Coding Horror's site: \n\nFinally, when you create a new post on your site, it automatically has the\ncomments feature once you hit publish 🎉\n\nStyling your Embedded content (Optional)\nOn the latest build of Discourse it is possible to add a stylesheet for your\nembedded comments.

Cloudinary is a paid service, however it does\ncome with a free tier which is more than sufficient for most people.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to integrate it with Ghost.\n\nAutomatic optimisation with fetch\nGhost has automatic responsive image sizes\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/responsive-images/]  built in by\ndefault, allowing you to output images at different sizes depending on the needs\nof your theme. If you prefer to use an externally hosted media solution, though,\nCloudinary can do the same thing via API.\n\nCloudinary's Fetch remote images\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images]  service is a simple\nway to deliver externally optimised images. For example, if you have 2000px\ncover images on all your posts, but on your homepage you want to display 200px\nthumbnails which are properly resized and optimised, then Cloudinary can take\ncare of that part for you automatically just by prefixing your feature images\nwith a special URL.\n\nEdit your theme files\nFirst, you'll need to sign up for a Cloudinary account and then edit your Ghost\ntheme files with updated image URLs. In this example, we'll look at the partial\nfile used for all post archives in Ghost's default theme, Casper\n[https://github.com/tryghost/casper].\n\nOn line 4  of /partials/post-card.hbs  we can see the code used to output the\npost's feature image in post lists. This piece of code is used on the home page,\ntag archives, and author archives - so any changes made here will update\neverywhere.\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url({{feature_image}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nTo have Cloudinary resize this image automatically to a more appropriate size,\nall you have to do is replace the {{feature_image}}  helper with your Cloudinary\nURL + an absolute image path. For example: \nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url\nfeature_image absolute=\"true\"}}\n\nCloudinary will automatically resize the image to fit within a 600x400px box,\nmaintaining the original aspect ratio, and return the image as normal. You can\ncustomise how you want the image to be modified based on your own needs, using\nCloudinary's image transformation features\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations].\n\nThe final code in your theme should look like:\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url feature_image absolute=\"true\"}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nDon't forget to replace YOURUSERNAME  with your Cloudinary username. Once you've\nsaved and uploaded your theme, your images will be automatically delivered by\nCloudinary's CDN and resized on the fly.\n\nFull Cloudinary storage adapter\nBy default, Ghost stores any images uploaded to Ghost Admin locally to its\nfilesystem, and delivers them via the same Ghost front-end service which\ndelivers Ghost themes. However, it's also possible to replace this layer\nentirely using a custom storage adapter, to upload and serve images directly\nto/from external services.\n\nUsing a storage adapter, images are uploaded directly to Cloudinary and\nintegrated into its media library, unlocking a larger quantity of advanced image\nmanipulation features which can be useful for people with image-heavy sites who\nneed a lot of processing – or people who want a detailed media management user\ninterface to manage their library of assets.\n\nGhost-Storage-Cloudinary [https://github.com/eexit/ghost-storage-cloudinary]  is\na heavily tested open source storage adapter  which contains detailed\ninstructions about how to configure it.\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nIt's also possible to connect Cloudinary to more of your favourite tools with\nZapier to make it more useful and powerful to your workflow.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"18 December, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-20T18:09:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-20T18:09:26.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-12-18T15:07:56.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3f8f906626b00bf6066c3","slug":"convertkit","title":"ConvertKit","excerpt":"Integrate Ghost with ConvertKit to sync your subscribers and make sending your\nemail campaigns more efficient\n\nWhether you're using ConvertKit to send one-off email campaigns to your readers,\nor running fully automated email marketing funnels - ensure your Ghost\npublication is fully integrated and your subscribers are in sync.\n\nHere are some different ways you can use Ghost and ConvertKit together:\n\nSync Ghost subscribers to ConvertKit\nIf you're collecting reader email addresses using the built-","feature_image":"https://docs.ghost.io/content/images/2018/09/convertkit.svg","plaintext":"Integrate Ghost with ConvertKit to sync your subscribers and make sending your\nemail campaigns more efficient\n\nWhether you're using ConvertKit to send one-off email campaigns to your readers,\nor running fully automated email marketing funnels - ensure your Ghost\npublication is fully integrated and your subscribers are in sync.\n\nHere are some different ways you can use Ghost and ConvertKit together:\n\nSync Ghost subscribers to ConvertKit\nIf you're collecting reader email addresses using the built-in subscribers\nfeature [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/enable-subscribers-feature/]  in Ghost, it's\npossible to link this with your ConvertKit account using Zapier.

This ensures subscribers in Ghost are always pushed to\nDrip or vice versa and keeps everything in sync, saving you the time of doing\nmanual updates.\n\nOnce this integration has been setup it'll run in the background and make sure\nthat your subscriber lists are always up to date.\n\nEmbed Drip email subscription forms\nIf you prefer to use Drip's own subscriber forms directly, it's possible to use\nany of the form builders, widgets or other embed options within Ghost. They can\nall be enabled or embedded efficiently using code injection or HTML cards in the\neditor. \n\nFirst you'll need to create a new signup form  in your Drip account:\n\nEach form you create has a unique reference name and can be configured\nindividually, with the option to use the embed code to inject raw un-styled\nforms in HTML, or the widget popup forms across your site.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form on a single post\nTo use HTML embedded forms, locate the embed code from within the form editor in\nyour Drip account: \n\nTo add the signup form to a particular post or page on your site, add a new HTML\nblock within the Ghost editor and paste the embed code there. \n\nOnce you hit publish, an un-styled (but functional) form will appear on your\npost or page. To add your own styling to this form, edit the CSS in your theme\nfiles and update your theme in Ghost Admin. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbed an HTML form across multiple pages\nOn the other hand, you can also insert the form HTML into the appropriate\ntemplate files within your theme.\n\nLocate the template file where you want to insert the signup form; usually \npost.hbs  right after the content. In Casper, Ghost's default theme, you'll see\na line of code specifically reserved for inserting comments. This also makes a\ngreat place for dropping in a newsletter signup form, so you can paste the code\nhere, too.\n\nMake sure you remove the comments on line 65 and 69After editing you'll need to\nsave the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you're self-hosting)\nrestart Ghost. The form should then be visible on every post!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse the widget form on multiple pages of your site\nIf you'd like to use the Drip widget forms on various parts of your site, go to\nyour account settings in Drip and copy and paste the Javascript snippet in the\nsite setup menu: \n\nThis snippet can be pasted into the site-wide code injection in Ghost Admin if\nyou'd like to implement the widget across your site. Additionally, Drip allows\nyou to specify which URLs the widget will appear on in the form editor for more\nfine-grained control.\n\nSetup an RSS to Email campaign\nIt's also possible to use the Drip RSS-to-Email\n[https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003731671-RSS-to-Email]  feature to\ngenerate automated newsletters of your latest content on Ghost, directly to your\nsubscribers!\n\nOnce you've activated the feature, wire up the RSS feed which you'd like to use\nto populate your newsletter content.
