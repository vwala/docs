However, when the default implementation of rss \n feeds in Ghost doesn't suit your requirements, you can create custom feeds\nusing the dynamic routing layer and a Handlebars template.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a custom rss  feed for a specific route on a\nGhost publication: \n\nAdd an rss  route in routes.yaml: \nIn order to create a custom rss  feed you'll need to add a new route, which is\nthe URL where your feed will appear.\n\nDownload the latest version of the routes.yaml  file from Ghost Admin and open\nit in any code editor:\n\nUnder routes add the URL where your new custom rss  feed will exist, for\nexample: \n\nroutes:\n  /news/rss/:\n    template: news/rss\n    content_type: rss\n\nCustom rss  feeds need to be defined with the content_type  property and mapped\nto a template as shown in the example above. \n\nCreate an new template\nThe next step is to create a custom template in your theme. Following the\nexample above, create a new template with the file name: news/rss.hbs. Here's a\ncode example of what a custom rss  template can look like: \n\n<rss xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\" xmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:media=\"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/\" version=\"2.0\">\n<channel>\n<title><![CDATA[ {{@blog.title}} ]]></title>\n<description><![CDATA[ {{@blog.description}} ]]></description>\n<link>{{@blog.url}}</link>\n<image>\n    <url>{{@blog.url}}/favicon.png</url>\n    <title>{{@blog.title}}</title>\n    <link>{{@blog.url}}</link>\n</image>\n<lastBuildDate>{{date format=\"ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ\"}}</lastBuildDate>\n<atom:link href=\"{{@blog.url}}\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/rss+xml\"/>\n<ttl>60</ttl>\n\n{{#foreach \"posts\"}}\n<item>\n    <title><![CDATA[ {{title}} ]]></title>\n    <description><![CDATA[ {{excerpt}} ]]></description>\n    <link>{{url absolute=\"true\"}}</link>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{{id}}</guid>\n    <category><![CDATA[ {{primary_tag}} ]]></category>\n    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ {{author.name}} ]]></dc:creator>\n    <pubDate>{{date format=\"ddd, DD MMM YYYY HH:mm:ss ZZ\"}}</pubDate>\n    <media:content url=\"{{feature_image}}\" medium=\"image\"/>\n    <content:encoded><![CDATA[ {{content}} ]]></content:encoded>\n</item>\n{{/foreach}}\n\n</channel>\n</rss>\n\n\nYou can copy and paste this exact implementation for your site, then go ahead\nand customise it to suit your needs!\n\nUpdate your active theme and routes.yaml\nOnce you've saved your changes, upload your updated theme in Ghost Admin as a \n.zip  file and upload your new routes.yaml  file. That's it, you've successfully\ncreated a custom RSS feed - you can test it out for yourself using the feed's\nURL!\n\nAdvanced RSS feeds for podcasting\nIf you're looking for a more detailed examples specifically for generating an\niTunes compatible podcast RSS feed, make sure you check out our in-depth\npodcast\nfeed tutorial [https://docs.ghost.org/tutorials/custom-rss-feed/]  for Ghost,\nwhich builds on the things covered here!\n\nDo more with Zapier\nAs always, you can power up your site even further using Zapier\n[https://zapier.com].

This key will give you access to\nall content in Ghost programmatically, outside of Ghost core. Optionally, you\ncan also add an icon and description of your integration for your own reference.\n\nMore information about using Ghost's Content API can be found in the full \nContent API Documentation [https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/].\n\nSet up a webhook\nOptionally, custom integrations can also deliver outgoing webhooks based on\nevents which happen in Ghost to trigger actions elsewhere. For instance, an\nexternal notification or rebuild command. Available events to trigger webhooks\nare:\n\n * Site changed  (rebuild)\n * Subscriber added\n * Subscriber deleted\n\nMore info about Ghost webhooks can be found in the webhook documentation\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/webhooks/].\n\nZapier integrations\nFinally, custom integrations can be easily created using Zapier to build simple\nor complex integrations, depending on your needs.\n\nCheck out the Zapier integration page\n[https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/zapier/]  for more details.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"05 November, 2018","published_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"19 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-11-05T08:49:32.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-11-11T09:07:55.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-19T09:23:25.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Content","slug":"content","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Marketing","slug":"marketing","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Email","slug":"email","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Analytics","slug":"analytics","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Community","slug":"community","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Surveys & Forms","slug":"surveys-forms","visibility":"public"},{"name":"SEO","slug":"seo","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"},{"name":"Social","slug":"social","visibility":"public"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"tagSlug":"marketing","tagName":"Marketing","tagURL":"/integrations/marketing/","tagDescription":null,"tagImage":null,"tagMetaTitle":null,"tagMetaDescription":null,"section":"integrations"}}
