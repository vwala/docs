For\nexample:\n\n * When a new post is published in Ghost (Trigger) Zapier can share your post to\n   Buffer  (Action)\n * When a new subscriber is collected in Mailchimp (Trigger) Zapier can add that\n   subscriber to Ghost (Action)\n\nSetting up Zapier is a case of deciding which actions you would like to happen,\nand when you would like them to be triggered.\n\nGet started with a Zap template\nTo get started we recommend using one of the recommended Ghost Zaps\n[https://zapier.com/zapbook/ghost/]. This will make it easy to get some of the\nmost popular automations set up in the space of a couple of clicks.\n\nCreate a custom Zap\nDon't see the service you want? Head over to Zapier.com [https://zapier.com]  to\nmanually create the exact automation you need. The guided Zap editor will help\nyou build the exact workflow you're looking for.\n\nUsage\nOnce set up, Zaps will run completely in the background without you needing to\ndo anything else. This is incredibly useful for automating tasks which you do\nregularly and don't want to have to remember - like automatically sharing new\nblog posts to social networks. It also comes in very handy for keeping multiple\ntools in sync, for example making sure that every time someone subscribes or\nunsubscribes to a newsletter in Ghost or Mailchimp, making sure that change is\nreflected in the subscriber databases for both services.\n\nIt's worth noting that some Zaps are instant, while others run in timed\nintervals. You may sometimes notice a 15 minute gap between a Trigger and an\nAction - this is perfectly normal.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"13 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"01 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-13T20:44:08.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-08-01T01:00:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-11T09:20:47.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3e1c906626b00bf606645","slug":"buffer","title":"Buffer","excerpt":"Post to all your social accounts automatically every time a new post is\npublished with Ghost, thanks to Buffer\n\nThe main benefit to using Buffer with Ghost is to automate and schedule your\npublication's social strategy with minimal overhead.

Following the\nexample above, create a new template with the file name: news/rss.hbs.
