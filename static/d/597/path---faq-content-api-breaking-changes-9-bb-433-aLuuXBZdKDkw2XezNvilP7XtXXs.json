Make sure you're running at least Ghost 1.1.0.\n 2. If you're not on Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/], then your trusted\n    domains will need to be re-added via the database.\n 3. Visit your blog to get the updated snippet - the URL has changed from \n    /shared/ghost-url.min.js  to /public/ghost-sdk.min.js, and your client\n    credentials may also be different.\n 4. Update your 3rd party site with the new URL, client id and secret (copying\n    the whole snippet is easiest).\n 5. Fix up any field names you're using which have changed.
