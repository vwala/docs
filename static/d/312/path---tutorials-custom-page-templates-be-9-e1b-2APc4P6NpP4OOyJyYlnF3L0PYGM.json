Create a custom template\nTo create a custom template follow this filename format: \n\ncustom-{{template-name}}.hbs\n\n\nReplace {{template-name}}  with only alphanumeric characters and dashes. This\nwill then be picked up as a custom template within Ghost. Ensure you pick a\nmemorable name, since this part of the file name will be transformed and shown\nin the dropdown menu as 'Template Name'. \n\nUsing this naming format is the only thing required to ensure Ghost picks up\nyour custom template, which can then be used in any post or page. \n\nFrom here you can create an entirely custom handlebars template to suit your\nneeds and edit your CSS files as required.

Our template is called Full Width. \n\nThere are countless use cases for custom templates, which can totally restyle an\nentire post or page, or just to change a few small elements on the page. \n\nUsually, custom post templates are used for one-off pieces of content. If you\nneed a whole collection of content to be rendered with a specific template, use\ndynamic routing configuration instead. Implement new templates and CSS\nOnce you have finished creating your new custom template file and made any\nnecessary adjustments to your CSS, upload an updated version of your theme to\nGhost.\n\nTheme files should always be in the .zip  format, and you can import your\nupdated theme from the design settings menu in Ghost admin. \n\nNow you can test your new custom template on production by creating a new draft\npost, and selecting the correct template from the dropdown menu in the post\nsettings menu: \n\nThis menu will only appear when you have one or more custom templates uploaded\nin your theme!\nAdd content to your new post and preview it to see your new custom template and\nstyling in action. \n\nSummary\nNice!
