PayPal provides the ability to pay multiple influencers in a single secure step.</p>\n<p><strong>You can pay commission from either:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The influencers table or;</li>\n<li>An influencer's profile page or;</li>\n<li>The orders table</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I pay a specific influencer?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/merchant/2019-02-02-16-50-04.png\"></p>\n<p>You can pay an influencer <strong>all</strong> of their unpaid commission from either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The table on the influencers page or;</li>\n<li>The orders table on the influencer's profile page</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Option 1</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> influencers page (left menu) to see a table of your influencers.</li>\n<li>Select 1 or more influencers that you wish to pay.</li>\n<li>From the actions menu, select \"Pay by PayPal\". Then in the payment form, ensure that the appropriate payment filter is selected and; click Yes to begin the payment.</li>\n<li>You will then be forwarded to a PayPal page to complete the transaction. See below for more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Option 2</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the influencer's profile page and scroll down to the orders table.</li>\n<li>From the actions menu, select \"Pay by PayPal\" to open the payment form. If you have selected no orders, the payment form will be set up to pay out all unpaid commission for the influencer. Alternatively, you can select specific orders if you only wish to pay commission on those orders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/merchant/2018-12-03-21-57-45.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do I pay a influencer partially?</strong></p>\n<p>You can <strong>partially pay</strong> unpaid order commission from either the orders page (left menu) or from the orders table on an influencer's profile page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> orders page (left menu).</li>\n<li>Select the orders you wish to pay</li>\n<li>From the actions menu, select \"Pay by PayPal\". Then follow the steps in the popup window to initiate payment. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/merchant/2018-12-03-21-59-45.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do I pay all?</strong></p>\n<p>You can also pay all unpaid commission for all influencers from the table on the orders page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the orders page (left menu)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not select any orders</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the actions menu, select \"Pay all by PayPal\" and complete the payment form.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/merchant/2018-12-03-22-02-30.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>How to complete the PayPal payment form</strong></p>\n<p>When you use the \"Pay by PayPal\" feature, <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> will automatically set up a PayPal payment and will forward you to PayPal. You will be prompted to log in to PayPal and approve the payment. Once the transaction is approved, your influencers will be notified of their payment via email (from both us and from PayPal) and the <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> dashboard will update with the payment status.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To cancel the payment, <strong>DO NOT</strong> <strong>close the window</strong>. Instead, click the cancel button on the PayPal payment form (the grey button in the screenshot below). Otherwise the order commission that was to be paid via the payment will be locked. This lock is automatically released after 24 hours.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/merchant/2018-12-03-21-38-51.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Important PayPal notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We pay influencers using the currency of your store.</li>\n<li>If the payment does not transfer immediately, the recipient has 14 days to accept the payment before PayPal will reverse their payment and return funds to your account.</li>\n<li>PayPal limits us to paying a maximum of 6 people at a time. This is a limitation that affects all users of PayPal's adaptive payments broker solution. To work around this issue, simply replay the \"Pay all by PayPal\" step until all influencers are paid. If you are making payments each month, this should not be an issue. For larger merchants, we are looking at implementing a PayPal per-approval step which will allow you to grant <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> the ability to automate payments from your PayPal account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**Future PayPal improvements<br>\n**We are working on adding an additional PayPal solution that will be opt-in for power users. It will allow you to delegate trust to <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> to pay out commission automatically on your behalf.</p>\n<p><strong>Supported PayPal currencies</strong><br>\nUSD<br>\nAUD<br>\nEUR<br>\nGBP<br>\nCAD<br>\nHKD<br>\nJPY<br>\nNZD<br>\nSGD<br>\nCHF<br>\nMXN<br>\nPHP<br>\nTWD<br>\nTHB<br>\nSEK<br>\nPLN<br>\nNOK<br>\nDKK<br>\nCZK</p>\n<p><strong>What if the recipient (influencer) doesn't have a PayPal account?</strong><br>\nThis isn't an issue. PayPal payments will work even if the recipient does not have a PayPal account. The influencer will simply need to create a PayPal account using the same email address that they use for <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vwa.la</a> to receive their payments.  </p>\n<p><strong>What if the recipient's PayPal account is invalid/restricted?</strong><br>\nWe (and PayPal) will notify any influencer if their PayPal account is incomplete and requires their attention before PayPal will complete payment. Our orders feature will exclude paying out problematic influencers for 1 week after such an event. This means you can continue paying out other influencers whilst they fix their issue.  </p>\n<p><strong>Are there fees? Who pays them?</strong><br>\nPayPal transactions incur a small transaction fee. The fee will be incurred by the recipient (the influencer). We recommend that you communicate this with your influencers to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>My PayPal transaction failed, PayPal says that I should verify my bank account...</strong><br>\nPayPal takes security and fraud very seriously. If you see this message when trying to transfer money, you'll need to ensure that your bank account is linked to your PayPal account. This process is simple and is secure/safe. PayPal will make 2-3 small deposits into your bank account and will ask you to verify them. Once verified you'll be able to pay your influencers without issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Vwa.la</strong></a> <strong>says that my commission payment is pending, what does that mean?</strong><br>\nIf the influencer does not yet have a PayPal account, payments will be marked as pending. Once the influencer creates their PayPal account, they will claim your payment and the transaction will be marked as \"paid\".  </p>\n<p><strong>I support multiple currencies, which one does</strong> <a href=\"http://vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>vwa.la</strong></a> <strong>use?</strong><br>\nYour store may allow for the user to change currency. However, Shopify only supports a single operating currency. This means that from Shopify's perspective, all products and customer orders are always in your operating currency. <a href=\"http://Vwa.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vwa.la</a> only uses your operating currency when calculating commission calculations and making payments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cryptocurrency\"><a href=\"#cryptocurrency\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>We are investigating the potential of using Cryptocurrency to pay out influencer commission.
