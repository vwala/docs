For\nexample:\n\n * When a new post is published in Ghost (Trigger) Zapier can share your post to\n   Buffer  (Action)\n * When a new subscriber is collected in Mailchimp (Trigger) Zapier can add that\n   subscriber to Ghost (Action)\n\nSetting up Zapier is a case of deciding which actions you would like to happen,\nand when you would like them to be triggered.\n\nGet started with a Zap template\nTo get started we recommend using one of the recommended Ghost Zaps\n[https://zapier.com/zapbook/ghost/]. This will make it easy to get some of the\nmost popular automations set up in the space of a couple of clicks.\n\nCreate a custom Zap\nDon't see the service you want? Head over to Zapier.com [https://zapier.com]  to\nmanually create the exact automation you need. The guided Zap editor will help\nyou build the exact workflow you're looking for.\n\nUsage\nOnce set up, Zaps will run completely in the background without you needing to\ndo anything else. This is incredibly useful for automating tasks which you do\nregularly and don't want to have to remember - like automatically sharing new\nblog posts to social networks. It also comes in very handy for keeping multiple\ntools in sync, for example making sure that every time someone subscribes or\nunsubscribes to a newsletter in Ghost or Mailchimp, making sure that change is\nreflected in the subscriber databases for both services.\n\nIt's worth noting that some Zaps are instant, while others run in timed\nintervals. You may sometimes notice a 15 minute gap between a Trigger and an\nAction - this is perfectly normal.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"13 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"01 August, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"11 November, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-13T20:44:08.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-08-01T01:00:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-11-11T09:20:47.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Automation","slug":"automation","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba3e24b06626b00bf60664b","slug":"cloudinary","title":"Cloudinary","excerpt":"Deliver automatically optimised images using Cloudinary and Ghost in tandem,\neither on-the-fly or with full media library\n\nCloudinary [https://cloudinary.com]  is a full-stack media optimisation platform\nwhich automates processing and optimisation of images and video to help deliver\nthem efficiently to your readers.

Cloudinary is a paid service, however it does\ncome with a free tier which is more than sufficient for most people.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to integrate it with Ghost.\n\nAutomatic optimisation with fetch\nGhost has automatic responsive image sizes\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/responsive-images/]  built in by\ndefault, allowing you to output images at different sizes depending on the needs\nof your theme. If you prefer to use an externally hosted media solution, though,\nCloudinary can do the same thing via API.\n\nCloudinary's Fetch remote images\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images]  service is a simple\nway to deliver externally optimised images. For example, if you have 2000px\ncover images on all your posts, but on your homepage you want to display 200px\nthumbnails which are properly resized and optimised, then Cloudinary can take\ncare of that part for you automatically just by prefixing your feature images\nwith a special URL.\n\nEdit your theme files\nFirst, you'll need to sign up for a Cloudinary account and then edit your Ghost\ntheme files with updated image URLs. In this example, we'll look at the partial\nfile used for all post archives in Ghost's default theme, Casper\n[https://github.com/tryghost/casper].\n\nOn line 4  of /partials/post-card.hbs  we can see the code used to output the\npost's feature image in post lists. This piece of code is used on the home page,\ntag archives, and author archives - so any changes made here will update\neverywhere.\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url({{feature_image}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nTo have Cloudinary resize this image automatically to a more appropriate size,\nall you have to do is replace the {{feature_image}}  helper with your Cloudinary\nURL + an absolute image path. For example: \nhttps://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url\nfeature_image absolute=\"true\"}}\n\nCloudinary will automatically resize the image to fit within a 600x400px box,\nmaintaining the original aspect ratio, and return the image as normal. You can\ncustomise how you want the image to be modified based on your own needs, using\nCloudinary's image transformation features\n[https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations].\n\nThe final code in your theme should look like:\n\n{{#if feature_image}}\n  <a class=\"post-card-image-link\" href=\"{{url}}\">\n    <div class=\"post-card-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/YOURUSERNAME/image/fetch/w_600,h_400,c_fit/{{img_url feature_image absolute=\"true\"}})\"></div>\n  </a>\n{{/if}}\n\n\nDon't forget to replace YOURUSERNAME  with your Cloudinary username. Once you've\nsaved and uploaded your theme, your images will be automatically delivered by\nCloudinary's CDN and resized on the fly.\n\nFull Cloudinary storage adapter\nBy default, Ghost stores any images uploaded to Ghost Admin locally to its\nfilesystem, and delivers them via the same Ghost front-end service which\ndelivers Ghost themes. However, it's also possible to replace this layer\nentirely using a custom storage adapter, to upload and serve images directly\nto/from external services.\n\nUsing a storage adapter, images are uploaded directly to Cloudinary and\nintegrated into its media library, unlocking a larger quantity of advanced image\nmanipulation features which can be useful for people with image-heavy sites who\nneed a lot of processing – or people who want a detailed media management user\ninterface to manage their library of assets.\n\nGhost-Storage-Cloudinary [https://github.com/eexit/ghost-storage-cloudinary]  is\na heavily tested open source storage adapter  which contains detailed\ninstructions about how to configure it.\n\nDo more with Zapier automation\nIt's also possible to connect Cloudinary to more of your favourite tools with\nZapier to make it more useful and powerful to your workflow.","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"20 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"18 December, 2018","created_at":"2018-09-20T18:09:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-20T18:09:26.000+00:00","updated_at":"2018-12-18T15:07:56.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Utility","slug":"utility","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#integration","slug":"hash-integration","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"John O'Nolan","slug":"john"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5ba4007706626b00bf6066e5","slug":"lets-encrypt","title":"Let's Encrypt","excerpt":"Ensure your Ghost publication is secure with a free SSL certificate via a full integration with Let's Encrypt.","feature_image":"https://docs.ghost.io/content/images/2018/09/letsencrypt.svg","plaintext":"Making the web more secure with free SSL certificates, Let's Encrypt is a great\nway to make your Ghost site run on HTTPS\n\nWe strongly recommend that all sites use SSL, and plan to make it a mandatory\nconfiguration for Ghost in the near future.\n\nGhost(Pro)\nAll Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/]  sites come with automatic SSL\nenabled by default and require no setup of any kind, so if you use our hosted\nplatform to run Ghost: Configure a custom domain for your sites and you're all\nset!\n\nSelf-Hosting\nIf you're self-hosting, though, Let's Encrypt [https://letsencrypt.org/]  is\nfully integrated into our comprehensive Ghost-CLI\n[https://docs.ghost.org/api/ghost-cli/]  tool so that you can provision a new\nSSL certificate in a couple of steps by running:\n\nghost setup ssl\n\nThis will prompt you for a couple of details, including your email address -\nwhich is required for Let's Encrypt notifications about renewing your\ncertificate.
