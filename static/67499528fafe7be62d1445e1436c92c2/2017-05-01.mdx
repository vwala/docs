Thanks to the devs for their hard work creating this release.

What's new:

* You can now create [product / collection specific promotions](http://intercom.help/vwala/merchant-help/promotions-101)
* We've also implemented fully automated Referrer link and discount code creation / removal. This is a huge productivity win for merchants and referrers. We're also really excited to announce that at present, vwa.la is the only platform on Shopify to offer this capability :)

Notes for the technical:

* We've adopted HTTP/2 to dramatically optimise page load times
* We've also gone through our entire code base and optimised multiple parts of the application to improve data response times.
