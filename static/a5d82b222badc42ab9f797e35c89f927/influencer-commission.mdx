In vwa.la your influencers earn sales commission on all orders that they create for your store.

## How are orders linked to a influencer?

An order is credited to an influencer if the following conditions are true:

- The customer who made the order followed the influencer's link to your store.
- The customer who made the order used the influencer's discount code in your shopping cart.

We use cookies, local storage and IP matching to track your influencer leads. These trackers exist for 30 days and then expire.

You can customise your lead tracking time window and/or disable link based commissions from `customise > commission tracking rules`.

## How order commission is calculated?

Each influencer is given a unique, personalized influencer link and code.

When an order is received, we use the rules that you've specified via the `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section to calculate influencer commission.

### Formula example

- The influencer commission rate for Sarah is 5%
- Sarah's code or link was used by a new customer. The customer order total is $100 after a 10% discount was deducted. The customer order included $10 of shipping and taxes. 
- vwa.la calculates Sarah's commission using the profitable portion of the order (excludes taxes/shipping). Which is ($100 - $10) * 5% = $4.5

## How do I customise commission rates?

You can customise your influencer's commission rules via the `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section. 

## How do I give difference influencers different commission rates? 

You can [segment your influencers into groups](/merchant/influencer-group-specific-commission/) and reward the influencer's of each group differently.

Or you can commission rates to specific influencers.

All commission rules are configured via the `customise page > influencer commission, link & discount code rules` section of your dashboard.

## How commission is paid?

Please see our [payments guide](/merchant/paying-commission)

## FAQ

### Q. What happens if a customer returns a product and I already credited my influencer for it?

We only allow commissions to be paid out for orders that have been fulfilled and are at least 30 days old. This prevents incorrect commission payments from being made. We also track the full life-cycle of your orders. This means that we track order changes, refunds and cancellations so you can be assured that influencer rewards are always correctly calculated.

### Q. What type of influencer reward structure do you support?

We support:

- Percentage based commission
- Fixed amount commission
- Limiting commission by specific shopify products / collections 
- Limiting commission to new customers
